`agterm` is a native macOS terminal with a deliberately small interface and a full control API. Shells are organized into named workspaces, each holding the sessions for one project or context, and that hierarchy is the whole model: there is nothing else to learn before it is useful. Everything it holds is also an object a script can address. The bundled `agtermctl` creates sessions and types into them, reads a pane's text back, runs a program in an overlay and returns its exit status, sets a session's status glyph, opens the native picker, moves windows, and reads all of that state back out over a local socket.

The motivation is specific: running several coding agents at once means many long-lived sessions, each progressing on its own, and a tabbed terminal loses track of them quickly. Each agent works in a named session and reports whether it is active, blocked, or done, so it is obvious which one needs you. An installable skill teaches an agent the control model, so it can drive the terminal itself. None of that is a special agent mode; it is the same control surface anything else uses. With nothing scripted at all it is a capable general-purpose terminal for everyday multi-project work.

The design is deliberately minimal: it covers the use cases above and stops there. Features come in two kinds. One is just enough to get the work done. The other is the small set of things other terminals get wrong, done the way they should have been. There is no deep agent integration and no attempt to invent a new way of working with agents. You get a sensible minimum out of the box, plus a complete control API and CLI on top, so anything past the defaults you build yourself instead of waiting for it to ship.

What it does:

- **Workspaces.** Sessions are grouped under named workspaces like "work" and "personal", which keeps a screen of concurrent sessions organized. You reach a session by name, by recency, or from the keyboard.
- **Control API and CLI.** A bundled tool, `agtermctl`, drives almost everything over a local socket: create sessions, type into them, run a program in an overlay and read its exit status, move and resize windows, or post a notification tied to a specific session. A script or an agent can set up and drive its own layout, and send you a notification from the session it was working in.
- **Splits, scratch, and overlays.** Split a session into two shells side by side or top and bottom, open a scratch terminal over it, or run a program in a full or floating overlay without disturbing the shell underneath.
- **Agent skill.** An installable skill (Help ▸ Install Agent Skill…) teaches Claude Code or Codex the control model and the `agtermctl` commands, so an agent running inside agterm can build its own layout, run overlays, manage windows, and show images inline without you explaining the API.
- **Agent status.** A coding agent reports its state (active, blocked, or completed) onto its session's row, so you can see which of many running agents needs you. Status hooks for Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, and other agents install from Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks….

A lot of "does it have X?" questions have the same answer: bind X yourself. A `command` line in `keymap.conf` turns any shell line into a key chord, and an overlay gives an interactive program a real terminal over the session, so a file manager, a git UI, or a database browser is one line away. Bigger workflows become scripts, which is what the [cookbook](cookbook/) collects.

You are not meant to write those lines by hand. Install the agent skill (Help ▸ Install Agent Skill…) and ask the agent in your session for what you want, and it writes the line with the right syntax, targeting, and PATH handling. [Extend agterm](https://agterm.com/docs#extend) shows that, and teaches enough of the model to read and change what comes back.

For the real terminal work, rendering, VT parsing, and shell I/O, `agterm` embeds [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)'s engine (libghostty); everything above is `agterm`'s own.

## The model

- **Window.** A top-level bundle of workspaces and sessions in its own macOS window, with its own sidebar tree.
- **Workspace.** A named group of sessions for one project or context.
- **Session.** One running shell with a name, a working directory, and its own scrollback. It is the row you see in the sidebar, and it keeps running while you work in another one.
- **Split and scratch.** A session can split into two shells side by side or top and bottom, both sharing the one sidebar row, and it can open a scratch terminal over itself for a quick aside.
- **Overlay.** One program running in a temporary terminal over a session. It disappears when the program exits and leaves the shell underneath unchanged.

## Install

Pre-built releases are for **Apple Silicon (arm64) Macs running macOS 14 or later**. Intel Macs are not covered by the DMG but do build from source; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Releases are signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so macOS Gatekeeper opens them with no extra steps.

Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask umputun/apps/agterm
```

Direct download:

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [releases page](https://github.com/umputun/agterm/releases), open it, and drag `agterm.app` into `/Applications`.

The Homebrew cask already installs the `agtermctl` command-line tool; from the DMG, put it on your `PATH` with **Help ▸ Install Command Line Tool…**. The same **Help** menu also installs the agent status hooks and the agent skill, both optional and safe to rerun.

The skill is also published as a plugin from this repository, which puts it wherever your agent looks for one:

```sh
# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add umputun/agterm
claude plugin install agterm@agterm

# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add umputun/agterm
codex plugin add agterm@agterm
```

Install the skill by one route or the other, never both: two copies leave it undefined which one the agent picks.

## Scripting agterm

`agtermctl` drives a running agterm over a local unix socket, one command per invocation. Terminal output is not streamed; `session text` reads a session's buffer when a script needs to see it.

```sh
ws=$(agtermctl workspace new demo)                        # capture the new workspace's id
sid=$(agtermctl session new --workspace "$ws" --cwd "$PWD" --no-select)
agtermctl session split on --axis horizontal --target "$sid" # add a top-and-bottom shell
agtermctl session type $'pwd\n' --target "$sid"           # drive a session you are not looking at
agtermctl session text --target "$sid" --lines 10         # read its terminal back
agtermctl session status blocked --target "$sid"          # set the sidebar status glyph
printf '%s\n' staging production | agtermctl pick --prompt "Deploy where?"   # open the native picker
agtermctl tree --json                                     # dump the whole model as JSON
```

`session type` returns once the keystrokes are queued, so a following `session text` races the shell, and `pick` blocks until someone chooses.

The same interface covers windows, splits, overlays, dashboards, HUDs, notifications, events, themes, and restoration. Every command is at [agterm.com/commands](https://agterm.com/commands).

## Documentation

- [Documentation](https://agterm.com/docs) is the user guide: the workspace and session model, windows, splits and overlays, keymap, and settings.
- [Command reference](https://agterm.com/commands) documents every `agtermctl` command with its arguments and return values.
- [cookbook/](cookbook/) collects recipes built on the control API.
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers building from source.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) describes the internals: the module split, surface ownership, and the libghostty C boundary.

Sessions come back on the next launch with their directory, font size, and split state. Restore reconstructs that structure, not the running processes.

<details>
<summary>Ports, forks, reimplementations, and companion tools</summary>

A small ecosystem has grown around agterm. These are independent projects, not maintained here.

**Built on agterm**

- [agterm-linux](https://github.com/melonamin/agterm-linux) by [@melonamin](https://github.com/melonamin) is a Linux port (GTK4/libadwaita) built on the shared, host-free `agtermCore`. The macOS app stays here; the Linux frontend lives in that fork.
- [Rook](https://github.com/jokius/rook) by [@jokius](https://github.com/jokius) is a native macOS terminal fork that takes agterm in a different direction, with features outside agterm's intended scope. Both projects are deliberately opinionated, with different ideas about where a focused agent terminal should stop.

**Reimplementation**

- [agwinterm](https://github.com/yeroo/agwinterm) by [@yeroo](https://github.com/yeroo) is a native Windows terminal for AI coding agents (C#, Win32/Direct2D), an independent from-scratch homage to agterm's design.

**Companion tools**

- [agterm-remote](https://github.com/k0nsta/agterm-remote) carries agterm's agent-status colors and pushes to agents running in a remote tmux over SSH.
- [pi-agterm](https://github.com/khanton/pi-agterm) is a pi extension that reports agent status onto agterm's status indicator.

## Attribution

agterm embeds **libghostty**, the terminal engine from [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) (MIT). It does all the real terminal work: rendering, VT parsing, and shell I/O. agterm builds it from upstream source at a pinned commit via `scripts/setup.sh`, with no fork and no prebuilt binary.

The way agterm drives libghostty's C API from a SwiftUI/AppKit app, under the Swift 6 strict-concurrency toolchain, was learned from [macterm](https://github.com/thdxg/macterm) (`thdxg/macterm`, MIT). The libghostty bridge files (`GhosttyApp`, `GhosttyCallbacks`, `GhosttyResources`, `GhosttySurfaceView`, `WindowAppearance`) are adapted from it and each carries an attribution comment. The model, sidebar, persistence, control channel, and multi-window code are original to agterm.

SwiftUI guidance during development came from the [SwiftUI Agent Skill](https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill) by Antoine van der Lee (MIT). Special thanks to [@ksenks](https://github.com/ksenks) for recommending it.
