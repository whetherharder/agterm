/// of the titlebar strip, (3) paint the divider's own resize cursor, which nothing else writes, and
/// (4) restore an even split on a divider double-click. Attached as a `.background` on the primary pane so
/// its `NSView` lives inside the split's view tree without becoming a third arranged pane.
///
/// (1) Once the split has a real axis extent it restores `session.splitRatio` via `setPosition`, seeding
/// `splitRatioDefault` when none is stored. The fraction is of the pane area BELOW the titlebar band, which is
/// where SwiftUI lays the panes out; measuring against the full split height instead makes an even ratio render
/// uneven in compact mode. Only a divider DRAG captures the live divider back; `session.resize`, the
/// double-click reset and that seed write the session directly, while every other resize notification is a
/// layout pass whose transient frames (a collapsed pane, a stale inset) must not become the ratio. The next
/// `save()` (or the quit-flush) persists it, like a live cwd change.
///
/// (2) In COMPACT mode the SwiftUI `.padding(.top, titlebarHeight)` (30px) lands inside the window's
/// safe-area band, so the AppKit `NSSplitView` ignores it and grows to the FULL window height (verified:
/// its frame + both arranged panes span pt 0..windowHeight); the panes' top strip is then empty
/// terminal-bg (invisible against the window bg), but the divider draws BLACK through it — a streak up
/// through the transparent titlebar. The 48px inset clears the band, so normal mode is already bounded.
/// The fix is a CALayer mask hiding the split's top `titlebarHeight` strip: a layer mask clips without
/// reflowing the terminal grid (a SwiftUI `.mask`/`.clipped()` here scrolled the top row away), the empty
/// strip is harmless to clip, and it composes with translucency (revealing the window backing, never an
/// opaque color over the titlebar).
///
/// (4) A drag can't land exactly on 50/50, and `NSSplitView`'s own double-click gesture only collapses a
/// pane through the delegate SwiftUI owns, so the reset is recognized from a shared mouse monitor instead.
/// It sees the second click after the first one's divider-drag tracking loop ends, leaving dragging intact.
