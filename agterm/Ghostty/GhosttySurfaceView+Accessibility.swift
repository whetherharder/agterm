// Accessibility bridge for voice dictation / assistive tools — original to agterm.
//
// Upstream ghostty (1.2) added a *read-only* AX integration that mirrors terminal content for screen
// readers and AI tools; it deliberately does not advertise an editable field, so it does not engage
// dictation (their voice-control issue is still open). This file takes the opposite, dictation-specific
// tack: it advertises the surface as an editable text area so hold-to-dictate widgets anchor to it, but
// gated to the on-screen pane(s) so it does not regress screen readers or expose background sessions
// (see the gating notes below). The WRITE path and the settable advertisement are additionally
// focus-gated (the read-only exposure is not).

import agtermCore
import AppKit

/// Exposes the Metal-backed terminal surface to the macOS Accessibility (AX) system as an
/// editable text area — but only for the pane(s) actually on screen. Exposure is NOT focus-gated
/// (a visible split exposes both panes); only the write path and the settable advertisement are.
///
/// The surface renders its own contents on the GPU and is otherwise deliberately absent from
/// the a11y tree (see `DashboardView` — "the Metal-backed surface is not in the a11y tree").
/// The side effect of that absence: assistive and voice tools — VoiceOver and third-party
/// dictation apps such as MacWhisper — probe `AXFocusedUIElement` for a focused *text field*
/// before they engage. Finding none over the terminal, they never show their input widget or
/// route text into it (in agterm the MacWhisper hold-to-dictate widget simply never appears,
/// while it does in every ordinary NSTextView/webview terminal). The system Dictation is not
/// one of them: it starts and inserts through `NSTextInputClient`, with no text read from here (#555).
///
/// This extension reports the minimal shape of an editable text field: role `.textArea`,
/// focusable, with a settable value. Tools that insert via `AXValue` land in `setAccessibilityValue`;
/// tools that synthesize keystrokes already flow through `keyDown`. Inline text goes through the same
/// `NSTextInputClient.insertText` path the physical keyboard and IME use; a set carrying ANY control
/// character — a line break (LF, CR or CRLF), TAB, ESC, NUL, DEL, or anything else in C0; see
/// `AccessibilityInsert.needsPasteRouting` — instead routes through the bracketed-paste path
/// (`insertPasted`), so a newline can't turn into Return and submit the line and a tab can't fire the
/// shell's completion. That is a bracketed-paste (mode 2004) guarantee, so it holds only against a program
/// that has 2004 on — the same caveat ⌘V and drop carry (see `setAccessibilityValue`).
///
/// Two deliberate scoping choices bound WHICH panes a non-dictation AX client sees. They do not bound
/// what it is TOLD about an exposed pane — see the screen-reader and replace-semantics limitations below,
/// both of which are real and accepted, not closed by the gating:
///
/// - **Only the on-screen pane(s) are exposed** (`axExposed`, below). The deck eagerly realizes
///   every session's surface, so gating merely on `!viewOnly` would advertise one editable "Terminal"
///   per realized surface — N overlapping empty text areas over the visible one, and a writable AX
///   target for every *background* session. Gating on `deckVisible` (the same "on-screen pane, not
///   split-focus-gated" flag drag registration and cursor writes use) collapses that to at most the
///   visible pane(s); the write path additionally requires live focus.
///
/// - **We do NOT mirror live terminal contents into `accessibilityValue`** (that would pull VoiceOver
///   into reading the whole GPU-rendered grid, a much larger undertaking — and upstream's read-only
///   integration is the better home for that). The element only needs to *look* like a focused,
///   editable field so dictation engages; the value it reads back is empty.
///
/// Known limitation: `deckVisible` is not split-focus-gated (both panes of a visible split qualify, by
/// design — the same flag drag/cursor use), so a split exposes TWO "Terminal" text areas. Only the
/// first-responder pane reports `isAccessibilityFocused`, advertises its value settable, and accepts a
/// write; the other reads as a non-settable text area. A client that anchors on `AXFocusedUIElement`
/// (MacWhisper) targets the right pane; a client that enumerates by role/label sees the
/// unfocused pane is not settable and skips it. Accepted: only one pane can be the live text destination
/// at a time, and narrowing exposure to the focused pane would hide the other from screen readers.
///
/// One asymmetry follows from the settable gate being first-responder-only while the WRITE guard also
/// requires `isKeyWindow` (`liveFocus`): the first-responder pane of a visible-but-NOT-key window (a
/// second window while another holds key) advertises settable, yet its write is dropped because that
/// window isn't key. This is deliberate — settable must not flip to NO merely because agterm isn't key,
/// or a discovery-time probe would mis-cache it — and harmless in practice: a focus-anchoring dictation
/// client can't reach a non-key window (`AXFocusedUIElement` is nil when agterm isn't key), so only a
/// role/label-enumerating client hits it, the same class as the split case above.
///
/// Known limitation (SCREEN READERS): because the value is not mirrored, an exposed pane reads to
/// VoiceOver as a text area named "Terminal" holding zero characters — it now announces an EMPTY editable
/// field where before this file the surface was absent from the tree and VO moved past it to the sidebar.
/// That is a real regression for VO users, traded knowingly for dictation working at all: the honest fix
/// is mirroring the grid (upstream ghostty 1.2's read-only integration, a much larger undertaking and the
/// better home for it), not narrowing the exposure, which would take dictation with it. Do not read the
/// gating above as covering this.
///
/// Known limitation (REPLACE SEMANTICS): a terminal is **append-at-cursor** — there is no addressable
/// document value to replace, so `accessibilityValue` reports empty and a set inserts at the cursor
/// rather than replacing. The value is still advertised settable because AX-based inserters require it.
/// A client that DIFFS its intended text against the field before writing therefore reads empty every
/// time and re-sends its whole hypothesis on each revision, concatenating it ("list", "list all", "list
/// all files" → `listlist alllist all files`). Incremental inserters (MacWhisper, and any client that
/// sends only the delta) are unaffected, which is the common case; a set-then-read-back-to-verify client
/// is not supported here. Closing this needs the same content mirroring the screen-reader case does.
