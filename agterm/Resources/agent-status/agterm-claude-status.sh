# Claude Code status adapter installed by agterm's Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks command.
#
# A worker agent spawned from inside a session (headless `claude -p` from a tool call, a second CLI
# agent) inherits the spawner's AGTERM_* environment, so its own hooks would repaint the SPAWNER's
# row. This adapter keeps that ownership question inside the installed hook package: decide from
# process topology, not terminal state. The hook is a descendant of the agent that fired it, so
# exactly one agent between here and the pane means "I am the pane's agent"; a second one means
# another agent spawned mine, so stay silent. A consecutive run of one name counts once, because a
# launcher that runs the real binary without `exec` leaves one agent wearing several pids. A worker
# is therefore caught only when a surviving process, such as its tool call's shell, separates it
# from a same-name spawner. A direct child is accepted as reporting: a hook whose whole command is
# `claude -p ...` runs through `sh -c`, which execs it, and that worker repaints the owner's row.
# A tty test cannot answer this — a headless lane that legitimately owns its pane has none, and a
# worker under script/expect gets a fresh pty anyway.
#
# It fails OPEN (reports) whenever the chain is unreadable or severed, e.g. a detached worker whose
# spawner already exited: a missed guard is the behavior without this adapter, while a false silence
# is a bug with no symptom. The argv is forwarded to the shared wrapper verbatim, so the adapter adds
# a guard and changes nothing else; it never reads stdin, so a payload another hook wants is intact.

# exact names, not a glob: `claude*` also matches wrapper scripts such as claude-opus-worker.
# The list is the union of the hook-driven agents and shell/integration.sh's AGTERM_AGENT_RE
# default — one agent set split by detection mechanism, and the walk must count all of it: an
# integration-driven agent (say gemini) that spawns `claude -p` is a spawner too, and missing it
# here would let the worker's reset repaint the gemini pane. Keep the two lists in sync.
#
# An overridden AGTERM_AGENT_RE (integration.sh documents the export) extends the set beyond the
# literals, matched against the same argv[0] basename the literal list sees — not the typed command
# line the shell integration matched, so an override that inspects arguments won't extend the walk.
# The expression is evaluated as ERE; zsh under RE_MATCH_PCRE and fish read the same value as PCRE,
# so an override can be valid there and invalid here. `[[` then returns 2, which lands on "not an
# agent" and keeps the walk fail-open; the redirect swallows bash's complaint about the expression.
