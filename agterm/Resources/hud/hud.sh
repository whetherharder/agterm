# hud.sh — the panel painter agterm runs in a session's overlay slot for `session.hud.*`.
#
# One HUD-SPECIFIC environment variable, AGTERM_HUD_FILE, points at the rendered body the app writes (the
# surface also inherits the session environment and the overlay wrapper's own AGTERM_OVL_* pair):
#
#   <columns> <rows> <spinner> <pid> <interval> <textcolor> <blockwidth> [frame...]
#                                the PANEL's own cell grid, which the text is centered in; spinner 1 shows
#                                a glyph; pid is the app process that owns this panel; interval is the
#                                sleep between ticks; textcolor is the SGR PARAMETERS of the panel's
#                                foreground (38;2;r;g;b) or - for the terminal's own, wrapped in the escape
#                                below rather than converted here; blockwidth 0 is plain mode, any other
#                                value marks a markdown body of finished rows that wide; the frames, when
#                                present, are the spinner's animation, one single-column glyph each.
#                                HudLayout and HudSpinner own the color encoding, the frames and the
#                                interval, so a style or a color is an app-side edit and never one here
#   message lines                wrapped by HudLayout
#   (one empty line)             the separator HudLayout guarantees, when a detail follows
#   detail lines                 rendered dimmed
#
# a markdown body (blockwidth > 0) is instead rows HudLayout.markdownBody already wrapped, styled with their
# own SGR and clipped to the grid. they are printed verbatim at one shared offset: measuring them here would
# count their escape bytes, and an empty row is spacing, not the detail separator.
#
# Everything an update may change lives in that file, re-read every tick, so `session.hud.update` repaints
# in place; HudLayout.renderedBody owns why it rides there rather than in the environment. The grid is never
# measured here — no stty, tput, $COLUMNS or SIGWINCH — because the app derives it from the terminal font
# and the size it gave the panel; measuring would race that resize and disagree. Every app-side path that
# changes the panel's size rewrites the header, or this centers on a frame that is gone.
#
# Removing the file is how every teardown path stops the loop; the header's pid is the second stop, checked
# below.
set -uf

# ${#line} counts CODE POINTS only under a UTF-8 locale and BYTES otherwise, and code points is what the app
# counted (HudLayout.cellCount) — so without this every non-ASCII message centers wrong. A Dock-launched app
# inherits launchd's environment, which sets no LANG or LC_*, and an inherited LC_ALL would override LC_CTYPE.
