# Troubleshooting agterm and reporting problems

Two jobs: (1) diagnose a problem from inside an agterm session, (2) help the user file it on the repo
as a bug (issue) or a feature/question (Discussion) — safely, never posting without approval.

The full user-facing version of the diagnostics below is the repo's `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

## Diagnosing from inside a session

You are inside agterm (`AGTERM_ENABLED=1`). Use:

- **Live state** — `agtermctl tree --json`, `agtermctl window list --json`.
- **Keymap problems** — `agtermctl keymap reload` prints the parse-diagnostic count (`0` = clean). A
  non-zero count means `keymap.conf` has problems; `agtermctl keymap list` prints each one with its line
  and message, and the user also sees the list in Settings ▸ Key Mapping.
- **A keybinding does not fire** — `agtermctl keymap list` shows the chord each action resolved to AND the
  key equivalents the menu bar is actually dispatching. If the action's `chord` looks right but no `menu`
  entry carries it (or a different item does), the keymap is fine and the menu is the problem: SwiftUI
  rebuilds the menu only on the next app activation, so switch to another app and back, then relaunch if it
  persists. Exceptions: `undo_close` (⌘Z) and `toggle_fullscreen` (⌃⌘F) are delivered by a key monitor
  rather than a menu item, so they never appear under `menu` and their absence there means nothing.
- **Ghostty settings** - `agtermctl config reload` re-reads the ghostty config and prints the diagnostic
  count (`0` = clean). The count covers every config source, not just `ghostty.conf` (libghostty does not
  record which file a diagnostic came from), so check the Console log for the offending line. `ghostty.conf`
  (next to `keymap.conf`, always loaded) is where agterm customizations go; it overrides the bundled
  defaults, and the global `~/.config/ghostty/config` is NOT loaded unless Settings ▸ General ▸ Use my
  global Ghostty config is on. Values agterm emits from Settings load last and win over matching values
  here; the current list is at https://agterm.com/docs#ghostty. Use it for keys the UI does not expose,
  e.g. `macos-option-as-alt`. Most keys apply to open panes on reload, but layout keys (`window-padding-*`)
  and spawn-time keys (`term`, `shell-integration-features`) only take effect in a new session/window
  or after a relaunch. Full reference: https://ghostty.org/docs/config. Two values in it do NOT apply:
  `ssh-env` and `ssh-terminfo` for `shell-integration-features`. Ghostty implements them by replacing
  `ssh` with a wrapper calling a `ghostty` CLI absent from agterm's bundle, so agterm forces both off
  after reading the config and keeps every other flag. Setting either is by design a no-op, reports no
  diagnostic, and is NOT a bug. For remote terminfo, install the entry once per host and account with
  `agtermctl terminfo install <host>` (local-only, no socket; `-p`, `-i`, `-J`, `-F` pass through, other
  connection settings belong in `~/.ssh/config`, and the execution settings are the installer's own). The symptom it fixes is `less`, `vim` or `apt` on the remote
  warning that the terminal is not fully functional, because `TERM=xterm-ghostty` is unknown there.
- **Logs** (unified logging, subsystem `com.umputun.agterm`):
  ```bash
  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"' --info --last 30m
  ```
  Categories: `GhosttyApp`, `GhosttySurfaceView`, `WatermarkRenderer`, `NotificationManager`,
  `SettingsView`, `SettingsModel`, `CustomCommandRunner`, `ControlServer`.
- **Files** — keymap `~/.config/agterm/keymap.conf`; agterm-scoped ghostty config
  `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf`; settings `~/Library/Application Support/agterm/settings.json`;
  socket path in `$AGTERM_SOCKET`.

### "Keymap editor won't open"

Edit Keymap runs `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` (else `vi`) in an overlay via the login shell. The most common
cause is a **GUI editor launched without a blocking flag** (`code`, `subl`, `zed`, `mate`, `cursor`):
it returns immediately, so the overlay flashes shut. Fix: `export EDITOR='code -w'` (the editor's wait
flag) in the shell rc. `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL` must be **exported** (`export EDITOR=…`, or fish `set -gx
EDITOR …`) so it resolves regardless of your login shell — a non-exported value falls back to `vi`. It
also no-ops with no session selected or an overlay already open.

### "Custom action does nothing"

Causes, in order: a parse error (see the diagnostics); the chord conflicts with a built-in or another
custom command and was dropped to palette-only (it still runs from `⌃⇧P`, tagged `custom`); a reserved
chord (`ctrl+tab`, `ctrl+1`/`ctrl+2`); a first chord without a modifier or function key
(`f1` through `f20`); it does not fire while a text field (inline rename, a palette, Settings)
has keyboard focus,
though it DOES fire from a terminal pane or an empty window (every session closed); it runs in a non-interactive
`/bin/sh -c` (no aliases/functions, a smaller `PATH` — use absolute paths or `$SHELL -lc '…'`); a
non-zero exit posts a failure banner (meaning it DID fire and failed). Reload after edits:
`agtermctl keymap reload`.

### "An overlay or --command session opens then instantly closes"

The program exited immediately. Check `agtermctl session overlay result --json` — `exitCode: 127` is
"command not found": `session overlay open`, `session scratch --command`, and `session new --command`
run the program with the app's GUI `PATH` (the launchd default — no `/opt/homebrew/bin`), NOT your login
shell's PATH, so a bare Homebrew or other non-default binary isn't found. Fix: give an absolute path
(`/opt/homebrew/bin/htop`) or wrap in a login shell (`zsh -lc 'htop'`). Any OTHER exit code just means
the program ran and exited on its own — the overlay/session closes when its command finishes, by design.

⌘C/⌘V/⌘A copy/paste/select-all on any layout by default, via two layers.

The **Edit menu** owns them first: its stock Copy/Paste/Select All items carry ⌘C/⌘V/⌘A as menu key
equivalents, which AppKit matches against the character the layout produces. An enabled item consumes the
key before the terminal sees it. The items enable only when the terminal can service them — Copy needs a
selection, Paste needs something pasteable on the clipboard (text, or a file/web URL, which pastes as a
shell-escaped path), Select All needs a live surface. Cut stays disabled for the terminal (it still works in
a text field, such as the inline rename or a palette's search box). Undo and Redo are not in the menu at all:
agterm has no undo, and ⌘Z belongs to File ▸ Reopen Closed Item. Because these are standard menu shortcuts,
⌘C/⌘V/⌘A are NOT rebindable through `ghostty.conf`.

agterm's bundled ghostty defaults are the **fallback**, binding all three to the physical key POSITIONS
(`super+key_c`/`super+key_v`/`super+key_a`), matched by keycode regardless of the character the layout
prints. They fire whenever the menu equivalent does not: on a Russian/Greek/etc. layout the physical C key
yields `с`, so the menu's ⌘C never matches and the keycode bind runs instead; likewise a ⌘C with no
selection, or a ⌘V with nothing pasteable, leaves the menu item disabled and reaches the bind on ANY
layout. The three binds deliberately omit ghostty's `performable:` prefix so they always consume the key,
and one that cannot act simply does nothing. With that prefix the unperformed press fell through to key
encoding — invisible under legacy encoding, which drops ⌘ chords on macOS, but the kitty keyboard protocol
reports them and the program renders a stray `^[[…u` as text. This is why copy, paste, and select-all all
keep working on a non-Latin layout. (ghostty's own
`super+c`/`super+v`/`super+a` match the produced CHARACTER, so alone they would miss there — `super+key_a`
in particular exists because without it ⌘A would silently do nothing on a Cyrillic layout.)

To remap a shortcut ghostty still owns: a physical key name (`key_c`, `key_v`, …) matches by position on
any layout; a bare letter (`c`, `v`) matches the produced character. Edit `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf`,
then `agtermctl config reload`.

### "My live session came back as a fresh shell"

Check these in order:

- **Restart after selecting Live sessions.** The restore mode is fixed when agterm starts. Changing
  **Settings ▸ General ▸ Restore sessions** affects the next process, not sessions already open.
- **Read the eligibility reason in Settings.** Live mode requires zsh as the macOS login shell and the
  bundled zmx and zsh-integration resources. If the launch cannot use live mode, every pane starts as an
  ordinary shell.
- **Inspect actual backing with `tree --json`.** Primary and split surfaces report `backedByZmx`; the session
  field is true only when every existing primary or split is backed. The sidebar deliberately has no zmx
  indicator.
- **Confirm the pane is in scope.** Primary and split panes can survive. Scratch, overlay, and quick terminals
  are temporary by design.
- **Start from `agtermctl zmx list`.** It reports every daemon and the pane claiming it, with the
  restore mode as a header. `claimed` with zero clients is a CLOSED window's resting state, not a leak;
  `orphan` is what `zmx prune` takes. `unknown` means the pane inventory was incomplete, so nothing
  can be pruned until that is resolved.
- **A missing daemon is recreated, running the captured command.** A reboot or a stale daemon leaves nothing
  to attach, so agterm creates one under the saved name and replays the command that pane was running at the
  last clean quit. A fresh shell instead means no capture applied: the window was closed before the quit, the
  machine lost power or was force-quit, the process exited before quitting, SIGTERM was used, or the command
  is refused by `restore-denylist.conf`. `agtermctl zmx kill` is not one of these — it closes a shown split
  or promotes a primary rather than leaving a daemon to recreate. To check what was captured, read
  `foregroundCommand` in `windows/<id>.json` while agterm is STOPPED: the next launch moves it into memory
  and rewrites the file with nil, so a running app always shows null there.
- **A tool asks for the microphone again after every update.** The pane was created before the session
  host and reads `orphaned` in `agtermctl tree --json`, so macOS charges each tool version separately. Agterm ▸
  Reset Live Sessions… (or `agtermctl zmx reset --force`) ends those sessions' processes at the next launch
  and recreates them under the host; agterm quits and reopens itself, captured commands start again where
  possible, and the notification afterwards says how many sessions were covered. A session whose old process
  could not be confirmed gone gets no command restarted and the reset can be run again.
- **After an update, an attached session still needs a key press, or a zmx change seems missing.** A live
  session keeps the zmx it was created with through app updates. `agtermctl zmx list` marks such rows
  `outdated`; Agterm ▸ Reset Live Sessions… (or `agtermctl zmx reset --force`) recreates them on the current
  zmx, with the same cost as any reset: running work stops and agent conversations need resuming.
- **Switching modes ends detached live processes.** Selecting Fresh shells or Re-run commands and restarting
  reaps the live daemons in this state directory. An unavailable launch that still requests Live sessions
  preserves its claimed daemons for a later eligible launch.

SIGTERM to agterm should leave a backed pane's daemon and process alive for the next launch. Explicitly
deleting its session, workspace, split, or window kills it after any undo grace period.

A reattached screen can look slightly different without being a fresh shell. Usable text, TUI state, and
normal colors survive, but inline images, earlier OSC 133 prompt markers, program-changed palette entries,
and hyperlink metadata already attached to cells do not. New output behaves normally.

Saving settings with this version removes the legacy `restoreRunningCommand` key. If an older agterm opens
the same state directory later, it sees no restore setting and defaults to fresh shells.

### "`tree` shows `(not realized)` right after a launch that replays commands"

That is pacing, not a fault. A launch that replays commands starts each window's visible panes at once,
then the remaining replaying panes one at a time, a short interval apart, so tens of programs do not boot
in the same instant. A session whose MAIN
pane is waiting its turn reads `(not realized)` in `tree` and `realized: false` in `tree --json` until its
turn comes; a queued right pane shows no tag, since `realized` describes the main pane only, so a tree with
no tags is not proof the launch has finished. While a pane waits for its permit, its captured command stays
on the session.
Selecting it, or a command that must act on it (`session type`, `session search`, `session paste`,
`session selectall`, `font inc`/`dec`/`reset`), brings it up at once; reads such as `session text` and
`session copy` answer `session not realized` and leave it queued. A main pane still `(not realized)` long
after its neighbours came up is a different fault, not pacing.

### "My session restore override didn't fire"

You set `session restore` but the pane came back as a plain shell (or re-ran the old captured command).
Check, in order:

- **The launch is not in `rerun` mode.** A `set`/`--none` still saves policy, and `result.text` names the
  active mode. Select Re-run commands in General settings and restart agterm.
- **The pane resolved to the scratch, or you pinned `--pane right` on a session with no split.** Both are
  rejected at set time (`the scratch terminal is never restored` / `session has no split`), so nothing was
  pinned — re-read the command's output.
- **The pin landed on the other pane.** Pass `--json` when setting the override and compare `result.pane`
  with the pane you meant.
- **It already fired once this launch.** The override is consumed once per launch: after it runs, a second
  surface for the same pane in the SAME session (e.g. opening a fresh split with ⌘D) gets a plain shell. It
  is still pinned — `tree` reports `restoreCommand` — and fires again on the NEXT restart.
- **The split is still hidden.** Its identity and pin survive restart, but the surface is created only when
  the split is shown; the saved rerun policy applies then.
- **You reopened a closed session or a closed window, not relaunched the app.** The override fires only on
  an app-launch restore — Reopen Closed Item and reopening a closed window deliberately do NOT arm it. Quit
  and relaunch agterm to see it fire.
- **It is not the denylist.** `restore-denylist.conf` is deliberately bypassed for overrides — an override
  names its command on purpose — so a denylisted basename is never the reason it did not run.

Confirm what is pinned from `tree --json`: the node's `restoreCommand` (main pane) / `splitRestoreCommand`
(split pane) reports the persisted value, which survives after the override fires, so a read at any point
shows the truth.

### "notify says ok but no notification appears"

Check **Settings ▸ Notifications ▸ Show notification banners** first. With it off, `notify` succeeds and
the unseen badge still rises, but nothing is handed to macOS — the command answers `ok` with
`result.text` = `badge updated, but "Show notification banners" is off, so no banner was posted`
(a delivered notification carries no `result.text`). macOS must also have granted permission (System
Settings ▸ Notifications ▸ agterm), and Do Not Disturb / a Focus mode suppresses banners system-wide.

To separate "never posted" from "posted but not shown": `tree --json` shows a rising `unseen` on the
target session whenever the command reached the notification path, and the log above records both the
posted and the suppressed case under the `NotificationManager` category.

### "a tool cannot get a macOS permission"

Programs run in a session request Automation, Camera, Microphone, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos,
Location, Bluetooth, local network, speech recognition, system administration and system audio recording
through agterm while macOS attributes them to it. The prompt names agterm and the answer applies to
programs with that attribution. A dismissed prompt is never re-offered (`osascript` keeps returning
"Not authorized to send Apple events"). The user changes the answer in System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security
under the matching service, for example Automation ▸ agterm. This is macOS policy, not an agterm bug: do not file it.

### "a permission is granted but a tool still cannot use it"

A service shows agterm enabled in System Settings, yet a tool in a session is denied. One cause is a stale
grant: macOS stores each grant with a code requirement, and a grant made while agterm was signed ad-hoc
requires a bare code hash, so a rebuilt or reinstalled agterm no longer matches while the toggle still reads
on. Confirm it before concluding anything: save the row's raw `csreq` blob from the system TCC.db to a
file, the bytes rather than sqlite's printed output (`SELECT writefile('/tmp/ax.csreq', csreq) FROM access
WHERE service='kTCCServiceAccessibility' AND client='com.umputun.agterm'`), then run
`codesign --verify -R /tmp/ax.csreq /Applications/agterm.app`. Only `code failed to satisfy specified code
requirement(s)` is the stale grant; an extraction, parsing, or signature error needs resolving first. The
[stale-grant diagnosis](https://github.com/umputun/agterm/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#an-accessibility-permission-you-granted-stops-working-after-an-update)
in docs covers the `tccutil reset` and the re-grant. A confirmed stale requirement is a machine-state issue,
not an agterm bug: do not file it. A denial with a requirement that does match needs a different diagnosis.

### "a command cannot read ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop or ~/Documents"

macOS protects those folders, plus removable and network volumes, on its own: a separate mechanism from the
services above, gated by no entitlement, and agterm is not sandboxed. The per-folder usage-description
strings are optional and agterm ships one for each, so the prompt carries agterm's wording. The answer is
recorded against the app macOS holds responsible, so another terminal listing the folder proves nothing
about agterm. The user grants it in System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Files & Folders ▸ agterm, or
gives agterm Full Disk Access, which covers all of them at once. A dismissed prompt is never re-offered.
`/bin/ls -la <folder>`, against the failing folder itself, usually tells the two causes apart: `Operation
not permitted` for the privacy denial, `Permission denied` for ordinary permission bits, and some `ls`
replacements print the same wording for both. Needing the grant is macOS policy, not an agterm bug: do not
file it.

### "agterm would like to access data from other apps, over and over"

Use `agtermctl tree --json` to read `liveAttribution` and `splitLiveAttribution`; see the
[tree field definitions](reference.md#tree). The [App Data diagnosis](https://github.com/umputun/agterm/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#agterm-would-like-to-access-data-from-other-apps-keeps-coming-back)
covers the permission guidance: which panes keep agterm's attribution after a relaunch, and Full Disk
Access for `orphaned` and `app` panes. Needing the consent grant is macOS policy: do not file the consent
prompt itself as an agterm bug.

### "The agent-status glyph does not update"

Install the hooks from Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks…. For shell-integrated agents, start a fresh shell
so the installer-added `source` line takes effect. For Pi, restart it or run `/reload` so it loads
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/agterm-status.ts`; the extension installs only after Pi has created `~/.pi/agent`.
For OpenCode, restart it so it loads `~/.config/opencode/plugins/agterm-status.js`;
the plugin installs only after OpenCode has created `~/.config/opencode`.
The installed wrapper resolves the bundled `agtermctl` itself; a bare development build instead needs
`agtermctl` on `PATH`. Moving or replacing agterm.app invalidates the path the installer baked in — the
wrapper then falls back to `agtermctl` on `PATH`, and with nothing there the glyph silently stops
updating. Re-run Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks… after moving the app, or install the CLI with
Help ▸ Install Command Line Tool….

### "The agent-status glyph updates the wrong session"

One session's glyph blinks/changes while the work is happening in a DIFFERENT session — typically when
the agents run inside tmux (or a tmux-backed session manager like agent-deck). Cause: the working
process inherited another session's `AGTERM_SESSION_ID`, and the agent-status hook targets whatever id
it finds in its environment. The usual carrier is a long-lived daemon started from inside an agterm
session — a tmux server captures the spawning shell's `AGTERM_*` into its GLOBAL environment
(`tmux show-environment -g | grep AGTERM`), and every pane created on that server inherits it, no
matter which client attaches. Diagnose: find the agent's pid and check its real environment —
`ps eww <pid> | tr ' ' '\n' | grep AGTERM_SESSION_ID` — if the id is not the session the process
lives in, it leaked. Fix a poisoned tmux server without restarting it:
`for v in AGTERM_ENABLED AGTERM_PANE AGTERM_PANE_ID AGTERM_SESSION_ID AGTERM_SOCKET AGTERM_WINDOW_ID AGTERM_WORKSPACE_ID; do tmux set-environment -g -r "$v"; done`,
then restart the affected panes/processes (a respawn is enough; existing processes keep their
inherited copy). Prevent it: start daemons and session managers with the variables scrubbed
(`env -u AGTERM_SESSION_ID … <cmd>`, full list in SKILL.md), or from a shell outside agterm.

### "Claude Code's question/permission prompt is unresponsive after switching apps"

Known upstream Claude Code bug, NOT agterm. Do not file an agterm issue for it. While Claude Code shows
an interactive prompt (a question menu or a permission dialog), switching to another app and back leaves
it deaf to the keyboard (arrows and Return do nothing); the normal prompt and the shell still work. On
refocus agterm sends the standard focus-in report (`ESC[I`, DEC mode 1004); Claude Code's dialog handler
mishandles it. agterm emits correct paired focus-in/focus-out and is already macOS focus-first (the
refocus click is not forwarded into the pty), so the terminal is not at fault. Tracked as
anthropics/claude-code#72188 (mouse-click variant #72273). Workaround: answer before switching away, or
`Esc` the stuck prompt and let it re-ask.

### "Claude Code prints links as `label (url)` instead of clickable labels"

Detection, not rendering. agterm identifies as `TERM_PROGRAM=agterm` (see the env list in SKILL.md) and
Claude Code's hyperlink allowlist lacks that name, so it prints the URL. agterm renders OSC 8 links fine.
Workaround: `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1 claude` (Claude Code reads it before any terminal check), or
`env = FORCE_HYPERLINK=1` in `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf` for every new shell, after a config reload
(`agtermctl config reload` or File ▸ Reload Config) and a new session; that form also forces links into
redirected output. `env = TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty` there does nothing: agterm applies its identity after the
config file. Do not file an agterm issue for it; the fix belongs upstream (Claude Code recognizing `agterm`
or `TERM=xterm-ghostty`).

### "Every session restores to the directory it was created in"

NOT an agterm bug when a shell wrapper is in play. agterm learns a session's cwd only from OSC 7, reported
by Ghostty's shell integration, which is injected into the shell agterm spawns and does NOT survive that
shell replacing itself. A `.zshrc` that `exec`s a wrapper (Amazon Q CLI, Kiro CLI, Fig) replaces it before
the first prompt, so `currentCwd` is never written and every cwd consumer falls back to the creation
directory: restore, the directory under the session name, `session reveal`, and `{AGT_SESSION_PWD}`.
Confirm with `cd` then `agtermctl tree --json` — the session's `cwd` does not follow the `cd`. Fix in
`.zshrc`, below the block that replaced the shell:
`[[ -n "$GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR" ]] && builtin source "$GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR/shell-integration/zsh/ghostty-integration"`
(a no-op where it already loaded; bash, fish and nushell have their own files in that directory).

Three neighbouring cases share the cause; the block covers all but the last. `exec zsh` at a prompt
replaces a shell that already reported, so the cwd FREEZES at that moment rather than never being set —
the replacement reads `.zshrc`, so the block fixes it. `sudo -E zsh` and other nested shells are children,
not replacements: the cwd stays frozen while one runs, then the outer shell resumes at its next prompt. A shell inside tmux
needs the block AND a tmux setting — tmux is a terminal rather than a passthrough, so the pane shell's
report reaches tmux, which forwards it on only with its `osc7` terminal feature on, and its default
`terminal-features` does not grant that to `xterm-ghostty`: add
`set -as terminal-features ',xterm-ghostty:osc7'` to `~/.tmux.conf` and restart the tmux server.

Separate limit, unrelated to the block: the program runs on the wrapper's inner pty, which agterm cannot
see into, so the capture never reaches it and restore cannot bring that program back — pin it with
`session restore '<command>'` instead.

### "⌘-hover does not underline links inside tmux or vim"

By design, NOT a bug. Do not file an agterm issue for it. libghostty detects links only while the
foreground program has mouse reporting OFF, so a program that captures the mouse takes link handling with
it: ⌘-hover stops underlining, the pointer stays a text bar, and ⌘-click opens nothing, all four together
and only inside that program. Ghostty.app behaves the same. It is per-program, not per-category:
`tmux` with `mouse on` and stock `vim` (`defaults.vim` sets `mouse=a`) suppress it, while an agent CLI
that never enables mouse reporting keeps links working. Workaround: hold shift too (⌘⇧-hover, ⌘⇧-click).
A program can claim shift via `XTSHIFTESCAPE`, so `mouse-shift-capture = never` in
`~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf` makes shift always win; `mouse-reporting = false` there turns reporting
off for every program, trading in-program mouse support for always-on selection and links.

## Reporting: decide bug vs unsupported FIRST

- A **supported** thing misbehaves (a documented command/feature does the wrong thing, a crash, a parse
  bug) → a GitHub **issue**.
- The user wants something **not supported**, or it is a question / idea / "can it do X" → a GitHub
  **Discussion** (category `Ideas` for a feature request, `Q&A` for a question). Do NOT file a feature
  request as a bug.

## Hard rules for filing

1. **Never run any `gh` command without the user's explicit approval in this conversation.** Drafting
   is fine; posting needs a clear go-ahead ("post it").
2. **Check tooling first** — `gh auth status`. If `gh` is missing or not logged in, do NOT install or
   authenticate it. Give the user the prefilled content plus the URL to paste it into:
   - issue: <https://github.com/umputun/agterm/issues/new>
   - discussion: <https://github.com/umputun/agterm/discussions/new>
3. **Draft first.** Show the user the full title and body, and get explicit approval before any `gh`.
4. **Scrub sensitive content** before showing or posting: API tokens/keys, passwords, internal
   hostnames/IPs, usernames embedded in absolute paths (replace with `~` or `<user>`), private repo
   names, and the contents of a selection / `session.copy` / clipboard. When unsure, ask.
5. **Gather the repro facts yourself** where you can: agterm version (the user reads it from
   Agterm ▸ About Agterm), `agtermctl tree --json` shape, a scrubbed `keymap.conf` excerpt, a scrubbed
   `log show` excerpt.

## Issue template (bug)

```
Title: <short, specific>

What happened: <one or two sentences>
Expected vs actual: <…>
Steps to reproduce:
1. …
2. …
Environment: agterm <version>, macOS <version>
Logs: <scrubbed `log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"'` excerpt>
Config: <scrubbed keymap.conf lines, if keymap-related>
```

File it (only after approval) with `--body-file -` so a multi-line body is not mangled by quoting:

```bash
gh issue create -R umputun/agterm --title "<title>" --body-file - <<'EOF'
<body>
EOF
```

## Discussion (feature request / question)

```bash
gh discussion create -R umputun/agterm --category "Ideas" --title "<title>" --body-file - <<'EOF'
<body>
EOF
```

Use `--category "Ideas"` for a feature request, `"Q&A"` for a question. Same draft-first, scrub, and
explicit-approval rules apply.
