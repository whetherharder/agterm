# Contributing a recipe

Send a workflow you actually run. A script written for the collection rather than for your own day is the wrong kind of submission: if it has not driven your own sessions for a while, it has not been tested where it matters.

Open a pull request against `master` with the recipe directory, its README, and the index row, all in one change.

These rules cover recipes. The project-wide rules for everything else are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) at the repository root.

## Layout

One directory per recipe, kebab-case, named after what the recipe does rather than after its script (`park-and-resume`, not `agt-park`). It holds a `README.md` and whatever the recipe needs to run, and nothing more. A recipe that is only instructions, a set of `agtermctl` commands or `keymap.conf` lines the reader types in, is a README alone. Anything else it needs is one of these:

- **Scripts**, named by language as described below.
- **A config file** the reader copies into place, named for its purpose, when the recipe is configuration rather than code. It spares the reader retyping a block out of the README, where a brace lost in transcription kills every hook silently. Nothing lints it, so say in the pull request what reads it, the same as a script in an extension CI does not know.
- **An agent skill**, whether a chord hands work to it or the reader invokes it directly. Ship it as `SKILL.md`, or, for a recipe that drives more than one agent, one `SKILL-<agent>.md` per agent; every loader requires the installed file to be named exactly `SKILL.md`, so the suffix belongs to the recipe rather than to the agent. The skill is part of the recipe and is read the same way, so keep it to what this recipe needs rather than shipping your whole configuration.
- **Data files** the scripts or the skill read at run time, such as page templates, in a subdirectory.

*Setup* says where every one of these files goes. A skill that finds its scripts or data by path relative to itself keeps them in the subdirectories it names, such as `scripts/` and `assets/`, and *Setup* says they must be installed together.

Name scripts by their language, because the extension decides what CI does with them:

- `.sh` is POSIX or bash. CI runs `shellcheck` over every one, and it has to be clean.
- `.zsh` is zsh. CI parses every one with `zsh -n`, so a syntax error is caught, but shellcheck cannot read zsh and nothing lints these. A parse is not a lint, so run `zsh -n` yourself and read the script over before sending.
- `.fish` is fish. CI parses every one with `fish --no-execute`, the fish analogue of the `zsh -n` gate above. Nothing lints these either, so run it yourself and read the script over before sending.
- `.py` is Python 3. CI runs `ruff check` over every one, and it has to be clean. A regression script named `test_*.py` is also run through `python3` by CI. Say which Python version the recipe needs in *Requirements*, the same as any other external tool, and depend on the standard library unless the recipe genuinely cannot.

A recipe in another language is welcome, but say so in the pull request: nothing lints an extension CI does not know, and a recipe that arrives ungated is one the reader has to trust entirely on review.

Every script carries a shebang. A script the reader invokes directly is committed with the executable bit set; a perfectly good script committed non-executable passes every check and then fails on the reader's machine with "permission denied". A file that is sourced rather than invoked, a shell function the reader adds to `~/.zshrc` or a helper library another script in the recipe sources, is committed without it, and *Setup* never tells the reader to run it. A `test_*.py` that CI runs through `python3` needs no executable bit either way.

## The README template

Six headings, exactly these, in this order. CI checks that all six are present:

```markdown
# <Title>

<one-line summary>

<byline, when porting someone else's work>

## What it does
## Requirements
## Setup
## Usage
## How it works
## Limits
```

**Requirements** names the minimum agterm version the recipe needs, written as "X or later", plus any external tool it calls. Work out that minimum from the commands and flags the recipe uses rather than naming the version you happen to run, and say in the same line what shipped in it. The version is the contract: a recipe that breaks against a later agterm is fixed when someone reports it, and dropped if it stays broken and nobody claims it.

**Setup** is the exact steps, including where the file goes and how it is invoked or sourced. Anything machine-specific is a variable the reader sets, named and explained here.

**How it works** explains the mechanism, not the code line by line. The gotcha that cost you an hour belongs here.

**Limits** states destructive behavior in plain words. If the recipe closes sessions, deletes workspaces, or kills a running shell, say so in a sentence the reader cannot skim past. "Parking a project closes its shells" is that sentence; "state is not preserved" is not. Known caveats that are not destructive go here too.

When you are porting someone else's work, credit him by name with a link to his GitHub profile and to wherever you found it, as a byline under the summary line.

## Index row

Add a row to [README.md](README.md) in the same pull request:

| recipe | what it does | needs |
|---|---|---|
| [project-switcher](project-switcher/) | show only one project's workspaces | 0.18.0, jq |

The index is split into four tables, grouped by what the reader is trying to do, alphabetical within each. Pick the one that matches the goal rather than the tool, since the agent a recipe needs is already in its *needs* column:

- **Workspaces and projects** — arranging workspaces, windows, and where a session opens.
- **Sessions across restarts** — a tab coming back to what it was running.
- **Agent status and workflows** — reporting what an agent is doing, or an agent workflow driven from a chord or a skill.
- **Panes, pickers and input** — splits, overlays, dashboards, and getting text into the shell.

A recipe that genuinely fits two goes in the one its *What it does* line leads with. If none fits, say so in the pull request rather than forcing it: a fifth group is a fair outcome.

CI compares the directory set against the index in both directions, so a directory with no row fails, and a row pointing at a directory that does not exist fails too. It reads every table, so which one you pick does not affect the check. The check matches the link by its trailing slash, so keep it.

## Rules for the scripts

Call the CLI through an overridable variable, `AGTERMCTL=${AGTERMCTL:-agtermctl}`, so a reader whose binary sits somewhere unusual can point at it without editing the script. A hardcoded path works on your machine and nowhere else. The exception is a recipe made of `keymap.conf` lines: those are copied into the reader's own config, which has no variable indirection, so they use bare command names.

Nothing personal reaches a committed file. No absolute paths under a home directory, no host names, IP addresses, user names, or internal project and service names carried over from wherever the script came from. Replace each with a variable the reader sets, documented in *Setup*, with a neutral default. This applies to comments and example output as much as to code.

Keep a recipe standing on its own. If two recipes share a gotcha, both explain it, rather than one pointing at the other.

## What review looks like

Every recipe is read before it is merged, for three things: whether its commands, flags, and JSON paths are right against the current control API; what it destroys, and whether the README says so; and whether anything private came along with it. Nothing is executed during review, because a recipe run against the default socket runs against the reviewer's live terminal with real work in it.

Expect questions on all three. A recipe that is correct but silent about closing sessions comes back for the *Limits* sentence, not as a rejection.

## License

Recipes ship under the MIT license that covers the rest of the repository. Send only work you are free to license that way, and say where a ported script came from.
