#   agents    — a tool subtree containing another agent binary: a dispatched
#               worker or subagent that is still running
#   machinery — a tool subtree doing real work: tests, builds, installs,
#               anything whose leaves are not on one of the lists below
#   waiting   — a tool subtree whose every leaf is wait-shaped (sleep, flock,
#               a poll loop, a short ssh probe), or that has no leaves at all
#   remote    — long-lived ssh/scp subtrees, counted separately so the caller
#               can treat a remote run as running work
#   watch     — pure log-watcher pipelines (tail/grep), which accompany a real
#               run and must not read as "queued for more"
#
# What makes this possible: Claude Code runs every tool command — foreground
# and background alike — under a recognizable wrapper shell, `zsh -c source
# …/shell-snapshots/snapshot-….sh && …`, as a child of the agent process, while
# MCP servers and harness helpers are direct children WITHOUT that wrapper. So
# "is a tool still running" is a question about wrapper subtrees, and the
# helpers never pollute the count. That wrapper shape is undocumented; see the
# recipe's Limits.
#
# ssh is disambiguated by age rather than by name: a reachability probe lives
# seconds, a remote build holds its pipe for minutes, so an ssh older than
# AGT_SSH_WORK_SECS counts as a run and a younger one as a wait.
#
# The caller's own process chain is excluded, so a hook never counts itself.
# Every ancestry walk is hop-capped: a cyclic ps row must spoil a count, never
# hang the hook.
#
# Set AGT_SCAN_PIDS=1 to get a second line, "pids=…", listing the members of
# the MACHINERY subtrees only — the caller can then measure whether the work it
# is about to report is really computing. Waiters and log watchers are left out
# on purpose: an `rg` burning cpu inside a watcher subtree would otherwise vouch
# for machinery that is doing nothing.
# Set AGT_SCAN_PS_FILE to a file of "pid ppid etime command" lines to classify
# canned input instead of live ps, which is how this is tested.
