# while the sweeper runs from launchd, which starts with no such environment.
# Honoring it would put the two halves in two different directories on exactly

# Since agterm 0.26.0 the package wires the Claude hooks to
# agterm-claude-status.sh: an adapter that stays silent when the hook was fired
# by a worker agent spawned inside the session (a headless `claude -p` from a
# tool call inherits the spawner's AGTERM_* environment and would otherwise
# repaint the spawner's row) and hands every other post to agterm-agent-status.sh.
# Posting through the adapter keeps that guard; posting through the generic
# script would undo it. So the adapter is preferred when it is installed, and an
# older package without it falls back to the generic script. Set
# AGT_STATUS_SCRIPT to post through something else.
