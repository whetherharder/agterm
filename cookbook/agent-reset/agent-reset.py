"""Reset the coding agent running in an agterm pane, and nothing else.

Run as an agterm keymap custom command: the runner exports $AGT_SESSION_ID, $AGT_PANE and
$AGT_SOCKET, and spawns this under the app's launch PATH rather than a shell's.

The agent is read from the pane's live foreground argv rather than assumed, so the chord is inert
in a shell or another TUI. A reset is a slash command, which means something to a coding agent and
noise to anything else. Both agents take the same command; they differ in how it is submitted, so
each pane is matched on its own argv.

Fired from the PRIMARY pane it also resets the split's agent and clears the session's title-bar
context, because the primary agent owns the session: resetting it ends what the session was doing.
From the split it resets that one pane, since one of two agents finishing is not the session
finishing. The context clear is gated on the primary write succeeding - a failed write leaves that
agent still holding its task, so the line must keep describing it.

Usage: agent-reset.py
