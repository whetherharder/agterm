# Remote Claude session

One chord opens a tab that runs Claude Code inside a tmux session on a remote host, reconnects on its own, and reports the agent's status onto its own sidebar row.

## What it does

A laptop that goes to sleep, gets closed, or comes along in a bag takes every local agent with it. Moving the agent to a server that stays up fixes that, and the price is usually a handful of manual steps every time: ssh in, find or create the tmux session, `cd` to the project, start the agent, and do it all again after the connection drops.

This recipe folds those steps into two chords and one script on each side.

- **Open.** Press the key, and a picker lists the sessions already running on the host, then the projects it holds. Pick a session to reattach to it, or pick a project and type a name for a new one. A tab opens, named `⇅ name` so it reads as remote in the sidebar, in a workspace named after the project. Inside, ssh connects, tmux creates or attaches the session, and on the first creation Claude Code starts in the project's directory.
- **Reconnect.** When the connection drops, from sleep or a change of network, the tab reconnects a few seconds later by itself; the tmux session and the agent in it never noticed. After an agterm restart the tab comes back already reattaching, because its restore line is pinned to the same command.
- **Status.** The agent's lifecycle hooks on the host reach this tab's sidebar row through a port ssh forwards back to the local control socket, so the row pulses active, goes blocked on a permission prompt and flashes completed, the way a local session does.
- **End.** A second chord kills the remote tmux session, after a picker asks, and closes the tab. Detaching without killing is tmux's own `prefix d`, or just closing the tab: the session stays on the host, and the next open lists it.

Conversations survive more than the connection. The Claude Code session id is pinned to the tmux session's name on the host, so a host reboot brings the same conversation back with `--resume` on the next attach rather than starting a fresh one.

## Requirements

- agterm 0.22.0 or later, which fixed a custom command spawning with a `PATH` that could not resolve a bare `agtermctl`. The picker, `session new --command`, `session restore`, `session hud` and `session status --pane-id` the recipe rides on are all older than that.
- **Restore sessions** set to **Re-run commands**, or to **Live sessions**, under Settings ▸ General ▸ Sessions. The default is **Fresh shells**, and under it a restarted agterm brings the tab back as a plain shell, so the reconnect above does not happen.
- `jq`, `ssh`, and Python 3.9 or later on the Mac, which macOS ships as `/usr/bin/python3`. Python runs the status relay; without it the tab still works and the row stays idle.
- A host you can leave running, with `bash`, tmux 3.3 or later, Python 3.9 or later, `uuidgen` (util-linux), and `git`. tmux 3.3 is where `allow-passthrough` arrived, and `install` writes it unconditionally, so an older tmux fails to read its own config. `tic` (ncurses) is worth having for the terminfo `install` compiles, but without it a session simply falls back to `xterm-256color`. Only Linux hosts have been used.
- Claude Code on that host, reachable from the login shell's `PATH`, and signed in. *Setup* has both steps.
- The host's sshd allowing remote forwarding (`AllowTcpForwarding yes`, the default) for the status bridge, and agent forwarding (`AllowAgentForwarding yes`, also the default) for the Mac's keys to reach `git` and `clone` there. Without the first, tabs work and the sidebar rows stay idle; without the second, `git` on the host needs a key of its own.
- Key-based ssh to the host that works without a prompt, from a process with no terminal: a key held by the macOS agent, or one without a passphrase. `rsync` on both sides for the optional `sync`.

## Setup

### On your Mac

From this recipe's directory, a clone of the repository or the three files saved beside each other, copy the scripts somewhere together and make the local two executable; `install` below copies the host one across:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp agt-remote.sh agt-remote-relay.py agt-remote-host.sh ~/bin/
chmod +x ~/bin/agt-remote.sh ~/bin/agt-remote-relay.py
mkdir -p ~/.config/agt-remote
```

Save this as `~/.config/agt-remote/config`. The script sources it, so it is plain shell, and nothing here is exported or run by hand:

```sh
AGT_REMOTE_HOST=devbox                 # an ssh alias, or user@host
AGT_REMOTE_PROJECTS=projects           # the projects root on the host, relative to its $HOME or absolute
AGT_REMOTE_LOCAL_PROJECTS=$HOME/projects  # where the same projects live here, for the tab's local shell
AGT_REMOTE_COMMAND=claude              # what starts in a new session; may not contain a single quote
AGT_REMOTE_BADGE='⇅ '                  # the sidebar prefix; set it empty to keep bare names
```

A config file rather than variables on the keymap line, because two of the script's callers never see the keymap's environment: the tab's own process, and the line agterm replays after a restart.

Three more belong in the same file and are rarely set: `AGT_REMOTE_STATUS=0` turns the status bridge off entirely, `AGT_REMOTE_RETRY` is the reconnect wait in seconds (5), and `AGT_REMOTE_BIN` is where the host script lands on the host (`.local/bin/agt-remote-host.sh`). Two others are read before this file is, so a line here would not reach them and they are set in the environment instead: `AGT_REMOTE_CONFIG`, which points at the file itself, and `AGT_REMOTE_STATE`, this Mac's bookkeeping directory (`~/.agt-remote`).

Give the host an entry in `~/.ssh/config`. Its alias is what `AGT_REMOTE_HOST` names, and `HostName`, `User` and `IdentityFile` below are placeholders for yours. The `Control*` lines are what make the picker instant and let every tab share one connection; the `ServerAlive*` pair turns a dead connection into a reconnect within a minute instead of a frozen tab; `ForwardAgent` is what lets `git` on the host use this Mac's keys, so the host never holds one of its own, at a cost *Limits* spells out:

```
Host devbox
  HostName 203.0.113.10
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  ForwardAgent yes
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%C
  ControlPersist 10m
  ServerAliveInterval 15
  ServerAliveCountMax 4
```

Prove the connection before going further, since every step below rides on it. It has to work with no terminal and no prompt, which is how the tab's own process will call it:

```sh
ssh -o BatchMode=yes devbox true && echo ok
```

A prompt, a passphrase or a host-key question here is a failure: fix it in `~/.ssh/config` or with
`ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/<key>` first.

### On the host

Everything else on the host is done from the Mac. The commands are safe to run again, except the last, which mirrors and can delete; see its own note.

**1. Install.**

```sh
~/bin/agt-remote.sh install
```

Copies `agt-remote-host.sh` to `~/.local/bin/` on the host, compiles the Mac's terminfo entry there (tmux refuses to start under a `TERM` the host cannot name, and `xterm-ghostty` is one it does not know), and runs the host script's `setup`, which: creates the projects root; appends to `~/.tmux.conf` the lines that let the agent's clipboard and notification escapes through; makes `~/.profile` source `~/.agt-remote/env`; copies this Mac's `known_hosts` entries for github.com and gitlab.com to the host, so the host trusts exactly the forge keys the Mac has already verified and nothing is scanned blind (no entry here means none there, and the first clone then fails with a host-key error: run `ssh -T git@github.com` or `ssh -T git@gitlab.com` on the Mac once and reinstall); and merges the four status hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`. The merge keeps every hook already there, refuses to touch a file that is not valid JSON, keeps the file's mode, writes through a symlink rather than replacing it, and takes a timestamped backup only when it actually changes something. Those four events match what agterm's own **Install Agent Status Hooks…** wires up locally; `agt-remote-host.sh hooks` prints the block if you would rather merge it by hand.

`install` reports rather than fails: it ends with `host ready` either way, so the run is clean only when nothing precedes that line. A warning about `tmux`, `python3`, `uuidgen` or `claude` is the one you get, and nothing later repeats it. A missing agent in particular surfaces as a tab that opens on a bare shell with nothing running in it.

**2. Put the agent there.** Install Claude Code on the host the way you would on any machine; the recipe never does it for you. What it does need is that a login shell finds it, because that is the shell tmux opens and the one the agent is started from — an installer that lands in `~/.local/bin` usually qualifies and a binary reachable only from your interactive rc file does not, but the check is what settles it:

```sh
ssh devbox 'exec $SHELL -lc "command -v claude"'
```

**3. Sign in.** Claude Code on the host needs your subscription. On the Mac, `claude setup-token` opens the browser and prints a long-lived token; hand it over:

```sh
~/bin/agt-remote.sh auth
```

It asks for the token without echoing it and stores it on the host in `~/.agt-remote/env` as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, mode 600. The agent is started through a `sh -c` wrapper that sources that file first, so the token reaches it whatever the login shell and whichever startup files it reads, and never appears on a command line; `setup` also makes `~/.profile` source the file, which covers a shell you open on the host by hand — unless your login shell reads something else first, as bash does where `~/.bash_profile` exists, on RHEL, Fedora and Amazon Linux. Run it again to replace the token. Signing in on the host interactively instead, with `claude` and `/login`, works the same way and needs no token.

**4. Clone.** Every direct subdirectory of the projects root is one picker row, and until there is at least one the open chord has nothing to show and says so:

```sh
~/bin/agt-remote.sh clone git@github.com:you/api.git
~/bin/agt-remote.sh clone git@gitlab.com:group/backend.git api-backend
```

The clone runs on the host with your Mac's ssh agent forwarded, so any key the agent holds works there; `ssh-add -l` shows what it holds, and `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/<key>` loads one. The second argument names the directory when the repository's own name is not the project's.

**5. Sync, optionally.** This one mirrors rather than merges: `rsync --delete` means a skill, agent or command that exists only on the host is removed to match the Mac.

```sh
~/bin/agt-remote.sh sync
```

Copies `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `skills/`, `agents/` and `commands/`, whichever exist, to the host's `~/.claude/`, so the agent there follows the same instructions. Nothing else from `~/.claude` travels: `settings.json` carries this Mac's hooks and paths, and plugins are installed per machine.

### Back in agterm

Last, because a chord pressed before the host is ready reports a failure rather than opening anything.

Set **Restore sessions** to **Re-run commands** in Settings ▸ General, under Sessions; **Live sessions** does as well. The default is **Fresh shells**, and under it a restarted agterm brings the tab back as a plain shell and the reconnect the recipe promises does not happen. From agterm 0.26.0 the open chord reads the setting back and raises a banner when it finds the default still there.

Then add the chords to `~/.config/agterm/keymap.conf` and apply with File ▸ Reload Keymap:

```
command "Remote session" ctrl+shift+n>r ~/bin/agt-remote.sh open
command "Remote end"     ctrl+shift+n>x ~/bin/agt-remote.sh end "{AGT_SESSION_ID}"
```

`{AGT_SESSION_ID}` is replaced by the session the chord fired in, and is how `end` knows which tab it is about. agterm exports the same value into the command's environment, which `end` falls back to, but the token stays on the line for a second reason: a command body that names no session-scoped token is one agterm will fire from an empty window, with no session to end.

Any chord with a modifier works; a leader pair is shown because the two commands read as one family. A custom command cannot shadow a built-in, so a chord that collides is quietly demoted to palette-only and appears to do nothing, while staying reachable by name from the action palette. If `agtermctl` is not on your `PATH`, install it from Help ▸ Install Command Line Tool… and set `AGTERMCTL` to its full path in the config file, which the script reads but a shell command of your own does not.

`agtermctl keymap list` after the reload shows what every chord resolves to, which is the quickest way to tell a demoted entry or a wrong path from a script that ran and failed. Then press the open chord: the picker lists the projects you cloned.

## Usage

Press ⌃⇧N then R. The picker shows the host's running sessions first, each marked with the badge and noting whether something is attached, then the projects. Return on a session reattaches; Return on a project opens a second prompt, prefilled with the project's name, for the session's name. Esc anywhere opens nothing.

The tab opens in a workspace named after the project, with the badge in front of the session's name. Claude Code is already starting in the project's directory on the host.

Close the laptop, open it later: the tab prints that it lost the connection and is reconnecting, then the tmux session is back where you left it. Ctrl-C during the countdown stops the retrying and leaves a local shell in the tab.

Press ⌃⇧N then X in a remote tab to end it. The picker opens on "Leave running"; choose the kill row to stop the tmux session and close the tab. A plain ⌘W closes the tab and leaves the session running on the host.

From any shell, `~/bin/agt-remote.sh list` prints the host's sessions and projects, `~/bin/agt-remote.sh attach NAME PROJECT` reattaches by hand, and `clone` adds a project without leaving the Mac.

## How it works

The local script has three callers with three environments, and the design mostly follows from keeping them straight. The chord runs it detached, with `$AGT_SOCKET` and `$AGT_WINDOW_ID` and no terminal, so a failure has nowhere to print: it goes to the session it was fired from as a `session hud` panel, which is passive, so the terminal underneath keeps taking keystrokes, and a child of the script takes the panel down eight seconds later. A window with no session left falls back to `agtermctl notify`, and a run from a shell, where stderr is a terminal, just prints. The tab's process runs it with a terminal and the session's own `$AGTERM_*` variables. The restore line runs it typed into a fresh login shell after a restart. The config file is the one thing all three share.

`open` makes one ssh round trip, `agt-remote-host.sh list`, which prints running sessions and projects as TSV, and turns that into the picker's items with the session rows first. Only tmux sessions whose working directory is a project directory are listed, so the host's own sessions stay out, and only well-formed rows become items, so a login banner or a locale warning on the host's stderr cannot reach the picker. A picked session already carries its project, from tmux's own record of the directory it started in. A picked project opens a second `pick` with `--allow-custom` and no items, which is the palette's plain text prompt; the name is limited to letters, digits, `-` and `_`, since it becomes a tmux session name, a file name and an argv word on the remote command line.

The tab is `session new --command`, with the script itself as the command, so the process in the tab is the reconnect loop rather than a bare ssh. The loop runs `ssh -t` with the host script's `attach` as the remote command. Exit 255 is ssh's own "connection failed or dropped"; the loop waits `AGT_REMOTE_RETRY` seconds (5) and goes again. Any other exit is the remote command finishing, a detach or a killed session, and the loop hands the tab to a login shell so the scrollback stays readable and the tab does not vanish. `session restore` pins the same line, because the alternative, agterm's captured foreground, would replay the bare `ssh` and lose the loop.

On the host, `tmux new-session -d` followed by `attach-session -d` is the whole create-or-reattach story: `has-session` decides, and `-d` on attach detaches any other client so a tab forgotten on another machine cannot shrink this one. The agent starts through `send-keys` into the new session's shell rather than as the session's command, so when it exits the shell is still there and the tmux session survives, and because that shell is a login shell the agent is found where installers put it: a command handed to `new-session` runs with a `PATH` that has no `~/.local/bin` in it. The keys go to the pane's own id, since `send-keys` takes a pane and the `=name` prefix that addresses a session matches none. The typed line is a `sh -c` that sources the token file when there is one and execs the agent, which keeps the token off every command line and makes the launch the same under bash, zsh or fish; a host signed in interactively has no token file and starts the same way. The forwarded agent reaches the session through a link of its own, `~/.agt-remote/NAME.agent.sock`, repointed at the current connection's socket on every attach and exported to the agent, so `git` inside the session keeps working across reattachments. A single shared path would not survive: sshd runs `~/.ssh/rc` for every ssh command to the host, so any short one, a `list` or a `clone`, would repoint it at its own socket and leave it dangling on the way out, breaking `git` in every live session until the next attach. `kill` removes the link with the rest of the session's state. Its session id is a UUID minted on first creation and written to `~/.agt-remote/NAME.claude`; a later creation of a tmux session by the same name finds the file and, if the transcript exists under `~/.claude/projects/`, starts with `--resume` instead.

The status bridge has a relay on the Mac side, and that relay is the whole security story. `attach` starts `agt-remote-relay.py` on a unix socket in a directory it makes with `mktemp -d` under `/tmp`, private, atomic and unguessable, one per attach, so a fixed path in the shared `/tmp` can never be pre-created by another user, a tab taking a session over on the same Mac never shares a path with the relay it replaces, and a relay on its way out removes only a socket that is still its own. `$TMPDIR` is not used because unix socket paths cap near 104 bytes and macOS's is long. The directory goes when the attach ends; a hard kill leaves an empty one for macOS's periodic cleanup. The relay holds this tab's session id and pane token as fixed arguments, and forwards it with `ssh -R 127.0.0.1:PORT:<relay socket>`: a TCP port on the host, loopback only, that reaches the relay and nothing else. The relay reads one line, accepts it only if it is a `session.status` request whose status is one of the four states, rebuilds the request from scratch with its own target and pane, and only then speaks to agterm's control socket; every other line, including any target or pane the host tried to name, is answered `refused`. So what the host can reach on the Mac through this bridge is this one tab's status, and nothing else. The relay exits when the attach loop that started it is gone, so a hard-killed agterm leaves no listener behind.

The forward is established on its own before every attach. A short connection asks for `-R` on a random port and nothing else, with `ExitOnForwardFailure` so a refusal is an exit code rather than a warning, and bypasses any `ControlMaster` so that its forward goes away with it; only a port that passed is then used for the real connection, which asks for the same forward. Three ports refused in a row while a plain connection works means the host's sshd refuses remote forwarding, and the session then opens without its bridge and says so; a plain connection failing too is the network, and the loop waits and tries again. The real connection dropping later is just a drop: the loop reconnects, probing afresh with a new port. Nothing here rests on timing, and a fixed port would not do: a tab taking a session over from another one would ask for the port that other tab still holds. On each attach the host script writes the port it was given to `~/.agt-remote/NAME.target`; the target itself never leaves the Mac. A hook fires inside the tmux session, asks tmux which session it is in (`display-message '#S'` through the inherited `$TMUX`), reads the port from that file, and sends one JSON line with a two-second timeout. Rewriting the file on every attach is what lets a tab opened tomorrow, or after an agterm restart with a new pane token, be the one that lights up: the new attach starts a new relay with the new token and a new port.

The `end` chord reads the tmux name from a marker the open wrote under `~/.agt-remote/`, keyed by session id, falling back to stripping the badge off the tab's name, so a tab restored from an earlier install still ends cleanly. The picker's first row is the harmless one, so a Return pressed by reflex leaves the session running.

## Limits

**`end` kills the remote tmux session and everything in it, then closes the local tab.** The agent, any server or watcher running in that session, and its scrollback on the host are gone; the tab's local scrollback goes with the tab. There is no undo on the host side. The picker is the one confirmation.

**Closing the tab any other way leaves the session running on the host.** ⌘W, a closed window, quitting agterm: none of them reach tmux. That is the point of the recipe, but it also means sessions accumulate on the host until you end them; `list` shows what is there.

**A remote tab is not restored by the restore denylist logic.** The pinned restore line bypasses the denylist by design, so the tab always reattaches after a restart, as long as **Restore sessions** is on **Re-run commands** or **Live sessions**. Under **Fresh shells**, the default, a restarted tab is a plain shell and `attach NAME PROJECT` by hand brings it back.

**The reconnect loop is not a session recovery.** It retries ssh; it cannot bring back a tmux session the host lost to a reboot. The next attach recreates one by the same name and resumes the conversation, if the transcript survived on the host, but whatever else ran in the old session is not started again.

**The status bridge lets the host set this tab's status, and only that.** Anything on the host that can reach the loopback port, another user on a shared host included, can make the row pulse, go blocked or flash completed for that tab. It cannot name another tab, run a command, read the tree or reach any other control command: the relay on the Mac rebuilds every request and refuses everything but a status. A wrong status is the worst case, and `AGT_REMOTE_STATUS=0` in the config removes even that: no relay, no port, and the hooks, if installed, post nowhere.

**Names are sanitized, not free.** A session name with a space becomes hyphens; one with a dot, colon or anything outside letters, digits, `-` and `_` is refused with a banner, because tmux reads `.` and `:` as target syntax. Project directories may carry dots.

**Two agents cannot share a name.** The conversation id is pinned to the tmux session's name, so `new-session` twice for the same name, with the first one gone but its transcript present, resumes that transcript rather than starting clean. Pick a fresh name for fresh work, or delete `~/.agt-remote/NAME.claude` on the host.

**The picker reads the host live.** With the host down or unreachable, the open chord names the host in a panel over the session and opens nothing; there is no cached list. A dropped network is the common case, and it outlives the outage by up to a minute: every command rides the shared `ControlMaster`, whose connection has to fail `ServerAliveInterval` times `ServerAliveCountMax` before ssh replaces it. With `ControlMaster` configured the round trip is milliseconds, without it every open pays a full ssh handshake.

**Chords inside a scratch terminal or overlay can resolve to the wrong session.** `end` takes the session the chord fired in; from a scratch pane that may be a different tab than the one on screen. The picker names the session it is about to kill, so read the row.

**`AGT_REMOTE_COMMAND` and `AGT_REMOTE_PROJECTS` may not contain a single quote**, because both are spliced into a single-quoted word on the remote command line; the script refuses at startup rather than mangling them.

**`install` edits files on the host.** `~/.tmux.conf`, `~/.profile`, `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and `~/.claude/settings.json` each gain a marked block or entry, once. The tmux block is global and appended last, so its `set-clipboard`, `allow-passthrough` and `history-limit` override your own settings for those three; move the block above them to get yours back. A `settings.json` that is not valid JSON is reported and left alone, and the hooks are then missing until you fix it and rerun.

**A failed reconnect pin is reported, not fixed.** If `session restore` cannot save the tab's reconnect line, the tab still opens and works, and a banner carries the exact `attach` command to run by hand after the next agterm restart.

**`sync` mirrors and therefore deletes.** It runs `rsync --delete` on the four items it copies, so a skill, agent or command that exists only on the host is removed to match the Mac. It is the one step that is not safe to repeat blindly.

**A host that forbids remote forwarding gets no statuses.** The tab still opens, after three refused probes and a line saying the forward was refused, and the row stays idle for that attachment. Every attach costs one extra short connection for the probe; with `ControlMaster` in place for the real connection that is well under a second. Ask the host's admin about `AllowTcpForwarding` and `PermitListen` if you want the bridge there.

**The forwarded agent is usable from the host while an ssh connection to it lives.** `ForwardAgent yes` means anything running as your user on the host, root included, can ask your Mac's agent to sign with every key it holds. It cannot read a key out, and the socket dies with the connection that carried it, but that window is wider than one tab: with the `ControlMaster` entry above, it lasts until the shared connection goes, up to `ControlPersist` after the last tab detaches. `ssh-add -l` shows what is exposed; load only the keys the host's clones need. On a host anyone else can reach, leave `ForwardAgent` out of the `~/.ssh/config` entry: `clone` passes `-A` itself and still works, and what stops is `git` inside a session, which is then a host deploy key's job.

**The token in `~/.agt-remote/env` is your subscription.** It is a file on the host, readable by your user there; treat host access as account access, and rotate it with `auth` if the host is ever shared or lost.
