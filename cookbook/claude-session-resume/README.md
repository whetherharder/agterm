# Claude Code per-tab session resume

After a restart each tab reopens its own Claude Code conversation instead of a shared most-recent one.

## What it does

Keep several Claude Code sessions open at once, and after the terminal restarts each tab resumes its own conversation instead of a shared "most recent" one.

- Solves a concrete pain: multiple parallel Claude Code sessions survive a restart, each reopening exactly its own conversation.
- Zero mapping state: the first conversation id **is** the tab's uuid (`AGTERM_SESSION_ID`), and any recovery id is derived from it.
- Idempotent: the first launch pins the conversation to the tab (`--session-id`); later launches continue it (`--resume`).
- Non-destructive recovery: a metadata-only transcript is left in place and the tab advances to its next deterministic conversation id.
- Stays out of the way: `claude mcp`, `-p`, an explicit `claude --resume <other-id>`, and any launch outside agterm pass through untouched.
- Small, dependency-free, pure shell; options are function-local (zsh's `emulate -L`, fish's implicit function scoping), so nothing leaks into your interactive shell.

## Requirements

- agterm 0.3.1 or later, with **Restore running commands on restart** turned on under Settings ▸ General ▸ Sessions. Both `AGTERM_SESSION_ID` and that setting predate the repository's earliest tagged release, so 0.3.1 is the first version that can be named, not the version the behavior arrived in.
- `zsh`, or `fish`
- Claude Code, with its conversations in `~/.claude/projects/` (or wherever `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` points)
- Python 3.8 or later, plus both `zsh` and `fish`, only to run the bundled `test_claude_resume.py`. Using the recipe needs no Python.

## Setup

### zsh

The function has to be defined in `~/.zshrc`, the config your interactive login zsh reads. That matters: agterm feeds the restored command into that shell, so `.zshenv` and `.zprofile` are too early to intercept it.

Either paste the function from `claude-resume.zsh` into `~/.zshrc`, or keep the file and source it from there:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.zsh
cp claude-resume.zsh ~/.zsh/
```

then add to `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
source ~/.zsh/claude-resume.zsh
```

The file is sourced, never run, so it does not need the executable bit and is committed without one. Its shebang is there to name the shell it is written for.

Turn on **Restore running commands on restart** in Settings ▸ General, under Sessions. Without it agterm brings a tab back as a plain shell and there is nothing for the function to intercept.

New tabs and shells pick the function up on their own. In an already-open shell, run `source ~/.zshrc`.

To remove it, delete the function block, or the `source` line, from `~/.zshrc`.

### fish

Drop `claude-resume.fish` into fish's autoload directory, under the name the function is defined with:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/functions
cp claude-resume.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/claude.fish
```

Fish autoloads a function from that directory by filename on first call, in any shell, interactive or not, so there is no config file to source and no restart to arrange. This file too is sourced by fish's autoloader, never run, so it does not need the executable bit and is committed without one. Unlike the zsh version — which a non-interactive shell never sources at all — the function checks `status is-interactive` itself and passes non-interactive calls straight through, so a script invoking `claude` from inside a tab isn't intercepted.

Turn on **Restore running commands on restart** in Settings ▸ General, under Sessions. Without it agterm brings a tab back as a plain shell and there is nothing for the function to intercept.

New tabs and shells pick the function up on their own; an already-open shell does too, since fish resolves `claude` against the autoload path on next call.

To remove it, delete `~/.config/fish/functions/claude.fish`.

## Usage

Run `claude` the way you always do. The first launch in a tab starts a conversation pinned to that tab, and every later launch in the same tab continues it.

To check it: open a tab, run `claude`, say a few words, then restart the terminal. The tab should come back to the same conversation, and `ps` shows `claude --resume <tab-owned-id>`.

## How it works

agterm can remember the command running in a tab and re-run it on restart. The catch: it re-runs the command verbatim, and `claude` with no arguments is a *new* conversation, not a continuation.

The trick rests on two facts. Every agterm tab has a stable identifier (`AGTERM_SESSION_ID`) that survives a restart. And Claude Code lets you supply a session id from the outside (`--session-id`). The tab id can therefore identify its conversation and any deterministic recovery ids.

The function then wraps `claude`: on the first launch in a tab it pins the conversation to the tab id (`--session-id`). Later launches find that id under Claude's project directories and continue it with `--resume`. Looking up the id directly means the wrapper does not need to reproduce Claude's private project-path encoding.

Claude can leave a `bridge-session`-only file after switching conversations through `/resume`. Such a file is not resumable and also prevents reusing the id. The wrapper leaves the file untouched and derives another UUID by incrementing the final 32 bits of the tab id. It applies the same rule again if that id also has a metadata-only transcript. A conversation created by an older version of the recipe is still resumed because its id remains the tab id.

On restart agterm replays the remembered command, the function recognizes "its own" id, sees the conversation already exists, and reopens exactly that one. Each tab, its own.

On the agterm side that replay is a foreground-process capture. At quit agterm records the argv of whatever the pane was running, and on relaunch it types that line back into the tab's fresh login shell with each argument single-quoted. Quoting suppresses alias expansion but not function lookup, which is why a shell function named `claude` still catches the replayed line; in zsh an alias would not. fish has no such distinction, since its `alias` defines a function.

## Limits

- **agterm-specific.** It needs a stable per-tab identifier and relies on agterm feeding the restored command back *through the login shell*, which is how the function intercepts it. It will not work as-is in another terminal; you would adapt it to that terminal's equivalent.
- **Rests on restore behavior its author verified empirically rather than from documentation.** It could change between agterm versions.
- **One tab-owned conversation id at a time.** Simultaneous launches in the same tab can choose the same id and collide with Claude's transcript check. A split pane, a scratch pane and any overlay all run under the same `AGTERM_SESSION_ID` as the main pane, so a second `claude` in any of them counts as the same tab. A process that has switched elsewhere through `/resume` can leave a metadata-only id, which the next launch skips.
- **It shadows the `claude` command** with a shell function. Passthrough is handled, but the list of subcommands and flags that must not be touched has to be kept current if the CLI grows new ones.
- **It knows Claude Code's on-disk layout** (`~/.claude/projects/*/<id>.jsonl`). A Claude Code storage change can require a recipe update.
- **zsh or fish only** (the zsh version uses `${:l}`, the `(N)` glob qualifier, and `emulate`; the fish version uses fish-only syntax throughout). Bash needs a rewrite.
- **Existing conversations are not bound to tabs.** After installation, the first launch starts a conversation pinned to that tab. Conversations created by an older copy of this recipe are adopted by their matching tab id, but arbitrary earlier conversations are not.
- **Claude's `/resume` picker does not rebind the tab.** It switches the running process, but the next launch returns to the conversation owned by the tab id. To make agterm capture another conversation, exit and run `claude --resume <id>` from the shell.
- **Metadata-only transcripts remain on disk.** They are small, remain available for inspection and are skipped on later launches.
