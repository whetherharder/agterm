prompt='Below is a condensed Claude Code session transcript (oldest first) from the directory '"$cwd"'.
Summarize what was worked on so the user can pick the task back up.

Each user prompt is tagged with how long ago it was sent, e.g. "[3h ago] USER: ...".

Rules:
- split the session into distinct pieces of work, NEWEST FIRST, and cover ALL of it
- every distinct piece of work gets its own item — never merge unrelated work into one item, and
  never merge an investigation with the separate fix, review or merge that followed it
- 6 items maximum: if the session holds more, keep the 6 NEWEST and drop the older ones. produce
  fewer than 6 only when the session genuinely contains fewer distinct pieces of work
- "age" is the tag of the most recent prompt in that group, without its square brackets (e.g. "3h ago")
- "title" is at most 8 words
- "detail" is one sentence, at most 25 words, and never states the status
- "status" is judged from the WHOLE transcript, not from that group alone:
    done        the work reached a conclusion anywhere later in the transcript — committed,
                merged, pushed, verified, or a question answered. ALSO done when a later group
                continues it and that one concluded: an investigation whose fix was merged is done
    in progress no conclusion anywhere after it. normally only the newest group can be this
    blocked     it stopped on something unresolved and nothing after it resolved that
    abandoned   dropped with no conclusion and no later work on it
- when unsure between done and in progress, choose done — most work in a finished session concluded
- no markdown, no backticks, no quotes around names, lowercase prose throughout
