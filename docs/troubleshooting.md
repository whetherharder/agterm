# Troubleshooting

A guide to checking what agterm is doing, the most common problems, and how to report one that turns out to be a bug.

## Where things live

Paths assume the defaults. When `AGTERM_STATE_DIR` is set, the state files move under that directory instead of `~/Library/Application Support/agterm`.

- **Keymap**: `~/.config/agterm/keymap.conf` (or `$AGTERM_STATE_DIR/config/keymap.conf`, or a custom directory set in Settings ▸ Key Mapping).
- **Ghostty config**: `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf` (same directory as the keymap), an agterm-scoped ghostty config that overrides the bundled defaults and your global `~/.config/ghostty/config`.
- **Settings**: `~/Library/Application Support/agterm/settings.json`.
- **Window and session state**: `~/Library/Application Support/agterm/windows.json` plus one `windows/<id>.json` per window.
- **Control socket**: `~/Library/Application Support/agterm/agterm.sock` (or `$AGTERM_CONTROL_SOCKET` when set). A spawned shell sees the bound path in `$AGTERM_SOCKET`.
- **Logs**: the macOS unified logging system, under the subsystem `com.umputun.agterm`.

## Reading the logs

agterm logs to the unified logging system, so use `log` or Console:

```bash
# the last 30 minutes, all categories
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"' --info --last 30m

# follow live while you reproduce the problem
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"' --info

# narrow to one area
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm" && category == "CustomCommandRunner"' --info --last 30m
```

The categories are `GhosttyApp`, `GhosttySurfaceView`, `WatermarkRenderer`, `NotificationManager`, `SettingsView`, `SettingsModel`, `CustomCommandRunner`, and `ControlServer`. In Console.app, filter on the same subsystem.

## Checking the keymap

After editing `keymap.conf`, nothing changes until you reload it.

- **Settings ▸ Key Mapping** shows a read-only list of parse problems (a malformed line, a dropped binding, a conflict). This is the first place to look when a binding does not behave.
- **File ▸ Reload Keymap** re-reads the file. A reload that found problems posts a banner with the count.
- **`agtermctl keymap reload`** does the same from the command line and prints the diagnostic count (`0` means a clean reload).
- **`agtermctl keymap list`** shows what is actually bound: every built-in with the chord it resolved to, the custom commands, each diagnostic in full rather than just a count, and the key equivalents the menu bar is really carrying.

## A keybinding does not fire

Run `agtermctl keymap list` and compare its two lists. If the action's chord is what you expect but no menu entry carries it (or a different item does), the keymap is fine and the menu is stale: agterm rebuilds the menu when the app next becomes active, so switch to another app and back, and relaunch if it persists.

One built-in is legitimately missing from the menu list: `undo_close` (⌘Z) is delivered by a key monitor rather than a menu item, so that native text undo keeps working in the rename, palette and Settings fields. Its absence there is expected.

## The keymap editor will not open

**Edit Keymap** (File ▸ Edit Keymap…, or the `⌃⇧P` palette) opens `keymap.conf` in `$VISUAL`, else `$EDITOR`, else `vi`, inside a floating overlay over the active session. The overlay runs the editor through your login shell, so the editor resolves the same way it does in a normal terminal — whether your login shell is zsh/bash or fish.

Common causes when nothing usable appears:

1. **A GUI editor without its blocking flag.** Editors like VS Code, Sublime, Zed, and TextMate launch a detached window and return immediately, so the overlay opens and closes in a flash. Set the editor's wait flag so the launcher blocks until you close the file:

   ```bash
   export EDITOR='code -w'     # VS Code; also: 'subl -w', 'zed -w', 'mate -w', 'cursor -w'
   ```

2. **`$EDITOR` unset.** You get `vi` inside the overlay. Press `i` to start typing, then `Esc` and `:wq` to save and quit; the keymap reloads when the editor exits.
3. **No active session, or an overlay is already open.** Edit Keymap is a no-op with no session selected, or while another overlay or the quick terminal is up. Select a session and close any overlay first.

Set and **export** `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL` in your shell startup file (`export EDITOR=…` in `~/.zshrc`/`~/.bashrc`, or `set -gx EDITOR …` in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`), not just in the current shell. The overlay reads the *exported* value from your login shell, so a value that lives in one terminal session only — or one set without `export` — is not seen and falls back to `vi`.

## A custom action does nothing

Work down this list:

1. **Read the diagnostics.** Open Settings ▸ Key Mapping. A malformed `command` line is listed there and skipped.
2. **Chord conflict.** If your chord collides with a built-in shortcut or with another custom command, the binding is dropped and the command becomes palette-only. It still runs from the action palette (`⌃⇧P`), where it is listed with a `custom` tag. Pick a free chord, or run it from the palette.
3. **Reserved chords.** `ctrl+tab` / `ctrl+shift+tab` (the session switcher) and `ctrl+1` / `ctrl+2` (pane focus) are reserved and cannot be bound.
4. **Check the first chord.** A custom shortcut must start with a modifier or a function key (`f1` through `f20`). `command "x" g …` is palette-only; `command "x" cmd+g …` and `command "x" f5 …` bind.
5. **Focus.** A custom chord fires only while a terminal pane holds keyboard focus. When the sidebar, the inline rename field, a Settings field, or a palette has focus, the chord passes through. Click into the terminal first.
6. **The command runs in a plain `/bin/sh -c`, not your login shell.** It does not load `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, so shell aliases and functions are not available and `PATH` may be shorter than in your terminal. Use absolute paths, or wrap the body in `$SHELL -lc '…'`.
7. **Exit status.** A non-zero exit posts a failure banner with the code. No banner and no effect usually means the chord never fired (causes above). A banner means it ran and failed, which points at the command itself, its `PATH`, or its arguments.
8. **Token quoting.** `{AGT_SELECTION}` and the other `{AGT_*}` tokens expand raw into the shell line. For content that may contain shell metacharacters, use the `$AGT_SELECTION` environment form, which is already quoted. The token list is in the [keymap section of the documentation](https://agterm.com/docs#keymap).

Reload after every edit (File ▸ Reload Keymap, or `agtermctl keymap reload`). Edits are not applied until you do.

## Changing ghostty settings

Most terminal behavior comes from ghostty. Use agterm's Settings for its built-in controls and a config file for other ghostty keys such as `macos-option-as-alt`, `keybind`, and `window-padding-*`.

agterm reads four config sources, each overriding the one before it:

```
ghostty's bundled defaults  →  ~/.config/ghostty/config  →  <config dir>/ghostty.conf  →  agterm Settings
       (lowest)                    (your global config)         (agterm-scoped)             (UI wins)
```

- `<config dir>/ghostty.conf` (default `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf`, next to `keymap.conf`) is scoped to agterm only; the standalone Ghostty.app never reads it. Use it for keys you want in agterm but not everywhere.
- `~/.config/ghostty/config` is your global ghostty config, shared with Ghostty.app, and already in the chain.
- Values agterm emits from Settings load last and win over matching values in `ghostty.conf`. The [Ghostty config guide](https://agterm.com/docs#ghostty) lists the keys. Put everything else in `ghostty.conf`.

Edit `ghostty.conf` with **File ▸ Edit ghostty.conf…** (or the ⌃⇧P palette), which opens it in `$EDITOR` and reloads on exit, the same as Edit Keymap. After editing it elsewhere, apply it with **File ▸ Reload Config**, the action palette, or `agtermctl config reload`. A malformed line is skipped while the good ones still apply. The diagnostic count (shown in a banner and printed by `config.reload`, where `0` means a clean reload) covers every ghostty config source, not just `ghostty.conf`, because the diagnostics do not record which file they came from. Check the Console log for the offending line.

A reload applies most keys to your open terminals right away — colors, theme, `cursor-style`, `macos-option-as-alt`, and the mouse and clipboard keys all take effect on the visible pane. Two kinds of key cannot change for a terminal that is already running, though:

- **Layout keys** — `window-padding-x`, `window-padding-y`, and other size-affecting keys — do not re-apply to an open pane. libghostty re-derives a surface's padding only when it is first laid out, so a reload (and even resizing the window) leaves existing panes on their old padding. Open a new session or new window to pick up the change; the panes that were already open need a relaunch.
- **Spawn-time keys** — `term` and `shell-integration-features` — are read once when the shell starts, so a reload cannot change them for a shell that is already running. Open a new session, whose shell is spawned fresh, to apply them.

The full ghostty key reference is at <https://ghostty.org/docs/config>. One pair of values in it does not apply to agterm: the `ssh-env` and `ssh-terminfo` values of `shell-integration-features`. Ghostty implements both by replacing your `ssh` with a wrapper that calls the `ghostty` command-line tool absent from agterm's bundle, so in agterm the wrapper would fail on every connection. agterm forces those two values back off and keeps the rest of your `shell-integration-features` flags, so `ssh` stays the real `ssh`. If you need agterm's terminfo entry on a remote host, install it there once with `agtermctl terminfo install <host>`, which dumps the bundled entry and compiles it into that account's `~/.terminfo` over one interactive ssh connection; `-p`, `-i`, `-J` and `-F` are passed through, other connection settings belong in `~/.ssh/config` under a host alias, and the settings that decide how the command runs (no pty, stdin kept, no `RemoteCommand`) are the installer's own.

## Copy/paste and shortcuts on a non-Latin or alternative layout

⌘C and ⌘V copy and paste on any keyboard layout, non-Latin ones (Russian, Greek, and so on) included, because agterm binds them to the physical key positions rather than to the character a layout prints. The physical C and V keys then work no matter what those keys produce in the active layout.

The reason is that ghostty's own copy/paste binds match the produced character: on a Russian layout the physical V key yields `м`, so the built-in `super+v` bind never fires. The bundled agterm defaults add physical-key binds (`super+key_c`, `super+key_v`) that match by position instead.

Those binds always consume the key, even when there is nothing to act on: ⌘C with no selection does nothing at all, rather than reaching the running program. That is deliberate. The Edit menu disables Copy without a selection and Paste without pasteable content — on every layout — so those presses fall to the terminal's own bind, and a bind that declined them would let the chord through to key encoding. A plain shell shows nothing either way, but under the kitty keyboard protocol, which Claude Code and other TUIs turn on, the program receives the chord as a key report and renders it as text — a stray `с` or `^[[1089;9u` in the prompt. If you rebind copy or paste yourself, do not add ghostty's `performable:` prefix for the same reason.

The same distinction lets you remap any shortcut for your layout:

- A physical key name (`key_c`, `key_v`, `key_a`, and so on) matches the key's position, whatever character it prints.
- A bare letter (`c`, `v`) matches the character the active layout produces at that key.

If you use a Latin alternative layout (Dvorak, Colemak, AZERTY) and want ⌘C/⌘V at your layout's own C and V letters instead of the QWERTY physical positions, override them in `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf` with character-based binds, and unbind the physical defaults so the QWERTY positions are freed:

```
keybind = super+key_c=unbind
keybind = super+key_v=unbind
keybind = super+c=copy_to_clipboard
keybind = super+v=paste_from_clipboard
```

Reload with **File ▸ Reload Config** or `agtermctl config reload`. The keybind syntax is at <https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind/reference>.

## Other common issues

- **`agtermctl: command not found`.** Install it from Help ▸ Install Command Line Tool… (it symlinks into `/usr/local/bin`). You can also call it by its full path inside the app bundle: `agterm.app/Contents/MacOS/agtermctl`.
- **No desktop notifications.** Check **Settings ▸ Notifications ▸ Show notification banners** first — when it is off, `agtermctl notify` still reports success and the unseen-count badge still tracks, but nothing is posted to macOS. Since agterm 0.17.0 the command says so, answering `badge updated, but "Show notification banners" is off, so no banner was posted` instead of a bare `ok`. macOS must also have granted permission (System Settings ▸ Notifications ▸ agterm), and Do Not Disturb / a Focus mode suppresses banners system-wide.

  To tell "never posted" from "posted but not shown", run `agtermctl notify "test"` and check two things: `agtermctl tree --json` — a rising `unseen` on the target session proves the command reached the notification path — and the log below, which now records every posted and every suppressed notification.
- **A permission prompt carrying agterm's name, or a tool that cannot get one.** Command-line tools request Automation, Camera, Microphone, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos, Location, Bluetooth, local network, speech recognition, system administration and system audio recording *through* agterm, so the prompt names agterm rather than the tool. A dismissed prompt is not re-offered, the tool just keeps failing (`osascript` reports "Not authorized to send Apple events"). See [Why agterm asks for camera, microphone and the rest](#why-agterm-asks-for-camera-microphone-and-the-rest) for why, what a grant then covers, and where to change your answer.
- **A command cannot read `~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop` or `~/Documents`.** Those folders are protected by macOS itself, separately from the services above, and the grant is per application — another terminal reading them says nothing about agterm. See [A command cannot read ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop or ~/Documents](#a-command-cannot-read-downloads-desktop-or-documents).
- **Agent-status glyph does not update.** Install the hooks from Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks…. For shell-integrated agents, start a fresh shell so the `source` line added to your shell rc takes effect. For Pi, restart it or run `/reload` so it loads `~/.pi/agent/extensions/agterm-status.ts`; Pi status is only installed when `~/.pi/agent` already exists. For OpenCode, restart it so it loads `~/.config/opencode/plugins/agterm-status.js`; the plugin installs only when `~/.config/opencode` already exists. The hooks call `agtermctl session status`, so `agtermctl` must resolve first (see above).
- **Agent-status glyph updates the wrong session.** One session's glyph blinks while the work happens in another — typically when agents run inside tmux (or a tmux-backed session manager such as agent-deck). The working process inherited another session's `AGTERM_SESSION_ID`: the status hooks target whatever id is in their environment, and a long-lived daemon started from inside an agterm session (a tmux server is the usual carrier) captures that session's `AGTERM_*` variables into its global environment and passes them to every child it ever creates. Check `tmux show-environment -g | grep AGTERM` — if present, clear them with `tmux set-environment -g -r AGTERM_SESSION_ID` (and the other `AGTERM_*` names), then restart the affected panes. To avoid it, start such daemons with the variables scrubbed (`env -u AGTERM_SESSION_ID … <command>`) or from a terminal outside agterm.

## Every session restores to the directory it was created in

Sessions come back in the directory they were opened in rather than the one you left them in, the directory
shown under the session name never follows a `cd`, `session reveal` opens the wrong folder, and
`{AGT_SESSION_PWD}` in a custom command expands to the creation directory.

agterm learns a session's working directory only from OSC 7, which Ghostty's shell integration reports.
That integration is injected into the shell agterm spawns and does not survive that shell replacing itself.
A startup file that `exec`s another shell replaces it before it ever reaches a prompt, so the directory is
never reported at all and every consumer falls back to the one the session started in. Shell-wrapper
installers do exactly this: Amazon Q CLI, Kiro CLI and Fig add an `exec` block at the top of `.zshrc`.

To confirm it, `cd` somewhere in the session and run `agtermctl tree --json`: if the session's `cwd` does
not follow the `cd`, nothing is reporting it.

The fix is Ghostty's own recipe — load the integration explicitly, below the block that replaced your
shell:

```zsh
if [[ -n "$GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR" ]]; then
  builtin source "$GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR/shell-integration/zsh/ghostty-integration"
fi
```

It is a no-op in a shell that already loaded it, so it is safe to add unconditionally. bash, fish and
nushell have their own integration files in the same `shell-integration` directory. Removing the wrapper
works too.

Three neighbouring cases share the cause, and the block above covers all but the last:

- **`exec zsh` typed at a prompt** replaces a shell that has already reported, so the directory freezes
  where it was rather than never being set. The replacement reads `.zshrc`, so the block fixes it.
- **`sudo -E zsh` or any other nested shell** is a child rather than a replacement: the directory stays
  frozen while it runs, then the outer shell resumes reporting at its next prompt.
- **A shell running inside tmux** needs the block *and* a tmux setting. tmux is a terminal emulator rather
  than a passthrough, so the pane shell's report goes to tmux, which forwards it to agterm only with its
  `osc7` terminal feature on — and its default `terminal-features` does not grant that to `xterm-ghostty`.
  Add `set -as terminal-features ',xterm-ghostty:osc7'` to `~/.tmux.conf` as well, then restart the tmux
  server.

Restoring a running command has its own limit, unrelated to the block above: with **Restore running
commands on restart** on, a pane behind a wrapper does not come back running what it was running. The
program is on a second terminal the wrapper owns, which agterm cannot see into, so the capture never
reaches it. Pin what such a pane should re-run with `agtermctl session restore '<command>'`, which is read
back on `tree` and wins over the capture.

## ⌘-hover does not underline links inside tmux or vim

Inside a program that has turned mouse reporting on, ⌘-hover stops underlining URLs, the pointer stays a
text bar instead of becoming a hand, and ⌘-click opens nothing. All four go together, and they come back
the moment you leave that program.

This is not a bug. libghostty detects links only while the foreground program has mouse reporting off, so
a program that captures the mouse takes link handling with it. Ghostty.app behaves the same way. It is
per-program, not a property of any category of app: `tmux` with `mouse on` and stock `vim` (whose
`defaults.vim` sets `mouse=a`) both suppress it, while an agent CLI that never touches mouse reporting
leaves links working normally.

Hold shift as well — ⌘⇧-hover and ⌘⇧-click — to bypass the capture without changing any setting. A program
can claim shift for itself with `XTSHIFTESCAPE`, in which case add `mouse-shift-capture = never` to
`~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf` so shift always wins.

To turn mouse reporting off for every program instead, set `mouse-reporting = false` in the same file.
Selection and links then always work, at the cost of mouse support inside programs that wanted it — mouse
scrolling in `tmux`, clicking to position the cursor in `vim`.

## Claude Code's question or permission prompt stops responding after switching apps

While Claude Code shows an interactive prompt (a question menu or a permission dialog), switching to another app and back can leave that prompt unresponsive to the keyboard: the arrow keys and Return do nothing. The regular Claude Code prompt and the shell are unaffected, so you can still type there.

This is a Claude Code bug, not an agterm bug. When a window regains focus, agterm sends the standard terminal focus-in report (`ESC[I`, DEC private mode 1004), which any terminal does once an application turns focus reporting on. Claude Code's dialog input handler consumes that report instead of treating it as focus state, which wedges the prompt. It is tracked upstream as [anthropics/claude-code#72188](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/72188); the mouse-click variant is [#72273](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/72273).

agterm is behaving correctly: it emits paired focus-in and focus-out reports with nothing stray, and it follows the macOS focus-first convention, so a click that refocuses the window only focuses it and is not forwarded into the terminal. The trigger is the focus report itself, so any terminal with focus reporting on is affected the same way.

Workaround until the upstream fix: answer the prompt before switching away, or if you have already returned to a stuck prompt, press `Esc` to dismiss it and let Claude Code re-ask.

## Claude Code prints links as plain text instead of clickable labels

Inside agterm, Claude Code prints a link as `label (https://…)` rather than as an OSC 8 hyperlink, so a list of ticket or PR links becomes a wall of URLs.

agterm identifies itself to spawned shells as `TERM_PROGRAM=agterm`, with `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` carrying agterm's version, in place of the `ghostty` pair embedded libghostty would set ([#201](https://github.com/umputun/agterm/issues/201), [#203](https://github.com/umputun/agterm/pull/203)). Claude Code decides hyperlink support from a list of terminal names that does not include `agterm`, so it prints the URL. agterm renders OSC 8 links and ⌘-click opens them; only the detection is off.

Workaround: set `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1` for the tool. Claude Code reads it before any terminal check. Per command, `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1 claude` or an alias. For every new shell, add `env = FORCE_HYPERLINK=1` to `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf`, reload the config (File ▸ Reload Config) and open a new session; that form also forces links into redirected output, because the variable skips the tty check as well.

`env = TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty` in that file does nothing: agterm applies its identity after the config file. The durable fix is upstream, Claude Code recognizing `agterm` or `TERM=xterm-ghostty`. Reported in [discussion #583](https://github.com/umputun/agterm/discussions/583).

## Why agterm asks for camera, microphone and the rest

agterm's code signature carries seven resource-access entitlements: Automation (Apple Events), camera,
microphone, contacts, calendars, location and photos. agterm never touches any of them itself, and the
`NSxxxUsageDescription` strings in `Info.plist` say so.

They are there for the programs you run inside a session. When macOS attributes a command-line tool to
agterm, its permission requests are charged to agterm.
The [Live pane diagnosis below](#agterm-would-like-to-access-data-from-other-apps-keeps-coming-back)
explains when that attribution can be lost. This is attribution, not inheritance: the entitlement has to
sit on agterm precisely because the child does not get one of its own. Under hardened runtime, which
agterm is signed with, a missing entitlement does not
produce a denial. `tccd` refuses to prompt at all, records nothing, and agterm never appears in the matching
Privacy pane, so there is no way to approve it by hand either. The tool just fails, with nothing pointing at
the cause. Ghostty, kitty, iTerm2 and Macterm ship the same seven; WezTerm ships those plus Bluetooth.

**They grant nothing on their own.** An entitlement only makes the request possible. Every service is still
off until you approve it, and the first request raises the standard macOS prompt.

**What a grant gives away.** The answer is recorded against agterm, not against the command that asked for
it. Approve the camera once and every program in every session can use it from then on, with no further
prompt and no identity of its own, for as long as macOS attributes it to agterm. Code running as a
compromised agterm has the same access. That is the trade for running arbitrary tools in a terminal that can
obtain permissions at all, and it is worth knowing before approving something you only meant for one tool.

**Changing your mind.** Grants and denials both live in System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security under the
matching service, listed as agterm, for example Automation ▸ agterm. A dismissed prompt is not re-offered,
so if a tool keeps failing after you dismissed one, that is where to fix it.

## A command cannot read ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop or ~/Documents

`ls ~/Downloads` fails for a directory that belongs to you, and another terminal on the same Mac lists it
without complaint.

Those three folders, along with removable and network volumes, are protected by macOS directly. It is a
different mechanism from the section above: agterm is not sandboxed, and unlike the services listed there no
missing entitlement can suppress this family's prompt. macOS defines an optional usage-description string per
folder and agterm ships one for each, so the prompt carries agterm's wording. What matters is
that the answer is recorded against the application macOS holds responsible. Approving kitty or
Terminal says nothing about agterm, so a Mac where every other terminal reads the folder can still refuse
this one, and as with the services above a dismissed prompt is not re-offered and the command just keeps
failing.

Grant it in System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Files & Folders, where agterm appears with a switch per
folder once something in a session has asked. Full Disk Access covers all of them at once and accepts agterm
from the + button without waiting for a request, at the cost of giving every program you ever run in a
session that same reach — the section above covers what a grant gives away.

To tell a privacy denial from ordinary permission bits, run `/bin/ls -la ~/Downloads` — the real `ls`,
against the folder itself, rather than a replacement such as `eza`. A privacy denial usually reads as
`Operation not permitted` and ordinary permission bits as `Permission denied`, and some replacements print
the same wording for both.

## An Accessibility permission you granted stops working after an update

A tool that needs Accessibility is denied in a session, while agterm's toggle in System Settings ▸ Privacy
& Security ▸ Accessibility still shows it enabled. It can follow an update, or granting the permission to a
copy you built yourself.

macOS stores each grant with a code requirement the app must satisfy. When agterm was granted while signed
ad-hoc, that requirement is a bare code hash, so the grant is frozen to that one build; a different build,
or an installed release, has another hash and no longer satisfies it. The row stays and the toggle stays
on, but macOS matches the running app against the stored requirement, finds no match, and denies it with
nothing pointing at the cause. A grant made against the Developer-ID release stores its signing identity
instead, which later releases keep satisfying.

To recover the Accessibility grant, remove the stale row and grant the installed release fresh:

```
tccutil reset Accessibility com.umputun.agterm
```

Then open System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Accessibility, remove any lingering agterm entry with the
minus button, add `/Applications/agterm.app` with the plus button, and switch it on. Grant the release you
run, so the stored requirement is its Developer-ID signature and later updates satisfy the same requirement.

## "agterm would like to access data from other apps" keeps coming back

macOS App Data consent belongs to a running process and has no separate entry in System Settings.
If a Live pane loses its responsible process, commands in it can become responsible for themselves and
repeat the consent request.

Read `liveAttribution` and `splitLiveAttribution` in `agtermctl tree --json`;
the [tree reference](https://agterm.com/commands#tree) defines the values.
A pane marked `supervisor` keeps microphone requests attributed to agterm after you quit and relaunch
agterm. App Data is expected to behave the same, but has not been checked.

A pane reads `app` when its daemon was created without the session host, either by an older agterm or
because the host could not start; it remains attributed to the running agterm. When that agterm quits,
the pane becomes `orphaned`; the same happens to panes whose session host dies. Commands in an
`orphaned` pane remain responsible for themselves until the pane is replaced. Restarting agterm does not
repair this.

Agterm ▸ Reset Live Sessions… replaces every `orphaned` and `app` pane at once, and every pane whose daemon
was created before the recorded first launch with this zmx build, whatever its attribution. The dialog says how many
live sessions it resets; on Reset, agterm quits, ends those sessions' processes at the next launch and
reopens itself with the same sessions and layout, starting each captured command again where possible.
Other work running in those sessions stops, and agent conversations may need to be resumed by hand.
Other `supervisor` sessions are left alone. A notification afterwards says how many sessions
the reset covered; a session whose old process could not be confirmed gone gets no command restarted,
and the reset can be run again. `agtermctl zmx reset --force` does the same without the dialog.

For App Data prompts in `orphaned` or `app` panes, grant agterm Full Disk Access under
System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Full Disk Access; the
[folder-access section](#a-command-cannot-read-downloads-desktop-or-documents) explains the scope of that grant.
Full Disk Access does not grant the microphone. Its permission is controlled separately under
System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Microphone.

## Reporting a problem

Collect this before filing:

- agterm version (Agterm ▸ About Agterm).
- macOS version.
- The exact steps, what you expected, and what happened instead.
- A log excerpt from the `log show` command above, covering the moment you reproduced it.
- The relevant `keymap.conf` lines, if it is keymap-related.

Scrub anything private (tokens, internal hostnames, usernames embedded in paths) before sharing.

If you run a coding agent inside agterm (Claude Code or Codex with the agterm skill installed), it can help you write and file the report: it drafts an issue for a bug, or a Discussion for a feature request or question, shows it to you first, and never posts without your go-ahead.
