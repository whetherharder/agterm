# Ask dialog: control-driven modal question

## Overview

A caller (agent hook, script, recipe) needs to put a question to the user and learn which button was
pressed. Today the control API offers a searchable list (`pick`), one-way panels (`session.hud.*`,
`notify`), and a full program surface (`session.overlay.*`). None returns a chosen button, and a two-row
`pick` shows a search field and a list where a dialog is wanted.

`ask` adds a theme-styled, terminal-looking modal dialog: a title, an optional message, and one to six
caller-named buttons. It resolves with the pressed button's id, label, and caller index, or `escaped`
or `cancelled`.
The command family, blocking CLI, result retention, and tree read-back copy `pick` one to one.

## Context (from discovery)

- `pick` family is the template: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermCore/{Pick,ControlPick}.swift`,
  `ControlDispatcher+Pick.swift`, `agterm/Control/ControlServer+Pick.swift`,
  `agtermctlKit/MiscCommands.swift` (`Pick` command, poll loop, `abandon`), `SocketClient.pickExitCode`.
- Modal gates that read the pending picker today: `AppActions+Focus.swift` `pickActive`,
  `GhosttySurfaceView.pickOwnsFocus`, `WindowContentView.swift` auto-follow suppression and frontmost
  handling (`pick.pending`), `agtermApp.swift:482,729,736` (search cleanup, quick terminal summon),
  `AppActions.swift` `cancelPendingPick`/`cancelAllPendingPicks` (⌘W, termination), tree
  `pickPending` in `ControlServer.swift:747` and `ControlProjection.swift`.
- Pane anchoring exists for the HUD, but inside one session's own layer: `HudPaneAnchors` is published
  and consumed within `sessionDetail` (`WindowContentView+Detail.swift`), and the cached
  `Session.hudPaneFrames` is observation-ignored and stale for hidden panes. Neither can feed a window-level
  host, hence the dedicated preference in Technical Details. `ControlServer+Hud.swift`
  `resolveHudPlacement` resolves `--pane`/pane id against a session with `requireVisible` and is reused.
- Theme colors for SwiftUI views come from `GhosttyApp.shared.terminalBackgroundColor` /
  `terminalForegroundColor` (used by the sidebar, rename field, watermark); font family and size from
  `settingsModel.settings`. The HUD is a terminal helper program (`hud.sh`), not a SwiftUI view, so its
  transport is not reused; only its look is.
- Keyboard capture pattern for a SwiftUI modal without a text field: `DashboardKeyCatcher`
  (`NSViewRepresentable` owning first responder) in `agterm/Views/DashboardView.swift`.
- Docs surfaces: `.claude/rules/control-api.md`, `site/commands.html`, `site/docs.html`,
  `plugins/agterm/skills/agterm/{SKILL,reference,examples}.md`, `.claude/rules/menu-actions.md` (modal
  cover list).
- No command count is stated on any surface, and stays that way.

## Development Approach

- **testing approach**: Regular (code first, then tests in the same task)
- one task at a time; every task ends with its tests green before the next starts
- gates run once at the end: `cd agtermCore && swift test`, `make test-app`, `make lint`; targeted
  runs during work (`-only-testing:agtermUITests/ControlAskUITests`)
- host-free logic (model, validation, result shaping, CLI parsing) lives in `agtermCore`; the app target
  resolves windows, sessions, geometry, and draws
- update this plan when scope changes

## Testing Strategy

- **unit tests** (Swift Testing, `agtermCore/Tests`): model and controller, protocol round trip,
  dispatcher validation, projection, CLI parsing and exit codes. One test file per source file.
- **hosted UI tests** (`agtermUITests/ControlAskUITests.swift`, XCTest on `ControlAPITestCase`):
  render, click, keyboard, dismissal semantics, tree read-back, shared modal slot, pane anchoring. Keep
  the count small; each hosted test costs seconds.

## Progress Tracking

- mark completed items with `[x]` immediately when done
- add newly discovered tasks with ➕ prefix
- document issues/blockers with ⚠️ prefix

## Solution Overview

Decisions settled in design review (Eugene, with codex as second reader):

- **Modality: window-wide, like pick.** One shared pending slot per window for ask and pick; a second
  open of either is rejected. Every focus, zoom, auto-follow, search-cleanup, and quick-terminal gate
  that reads "is a picker pending" reads "is a modal pending" instead.
- **Placement: session-wide by default.** With a session target the dialog draws over that session's
  whole area, both halves of a split; `--pane left|right` narrows it to one half. With no session it
  centers over the terminal area, right of the sidebar and below the titlebar, exactly where the pick
  palette centers (`terminalAreaInset`). A supplied session or pane that is missing or not visible rejects the open;
  `--pane` without a session is rejected.
- **Anchor identity is captured at open**; its geometry follows resizes. The anchor is lost, and the ask
  resolves `cancelled`, when the anchored session is closed or deselected in its window, or when an
  anchored pane stops being rendered (`Session.rendersPane` false, or its pane identity gone). A
  session-wide anchor survives a split collapse, and a pane anchor survives while that pane stays on
  screen, maximized included. The dialog never relocates.
- **Zoom and dashboard**: an anchored open while terminal zoom or the dashboard covers the owning window
  is rejected with `session not visible`, since the deck under them is not on screen. An unanchored ask
  draws at terminal-area center above zoom and dashboard, exactly as pick does. Opening zoom, dashboard, quick
  terminal, or search while an ask is pending is refused by the shared modal gates.
- **Rendering has two styles**, selected by `style` (`terminal` default, `gui`), identical in every
  behavior. `terminal` is drawn over the pane in the theme's background and foreground with the terminal
  font: every button is a padded monospace label on a dim fill (foreground at low opacity),
  the active one solid foreground with background-colored text, hotkeys underlined. `gui` reuses the
  picker's material panel, corner radius and appearance handling with system fonts: headline title,
  secondary message, native push buttons in a trailing row, the current highlight prominent in the accent color,
  the destructive one tinted red and prominent red when highlighted, system colors only. Clicking outside the panel does nothing in either.
  `style` is decoration, so it has no read-back; an unknown value is rejected.
- Buttons in a row share the widest button's width. In a column they share its width, with long labels
  wrapping within it, in both styles.
- **Button block alignment** is `align` (`left`, `center`, `right`; default `right`), CLI `--align`, in
  both styles. It places the whole button block within the panel; the vertical fallback aligns its column
  the same way. Decoration like `style`: no read-back, unknown value rejected.
- **Panel width** is automatic in both styles: natural content width capped at 90 percent of the anchor
  and 72 cells. Optional `width`, CLI `--width N`, replaces that rule with a fixed integer percentage of
  the anchor from 10 to 100. Invalid values return `width must be 10 to 100`. It is decoration, with no
  read-back, and is carried on `PendingAsk`.
- **Dismissal is two kinds.** User dismissal (Esc, ⌘W) returns `escaped`, CLI exit 3. Administrative
  cancellation (`ask.cancel`, window teardown, app termination, CLI abandon, anchor loss) returns
  `cancelled`, exit 2. Neither synthesizes a button, and there is no cancel button role: a caller's
  "Cancel" button is an ordinary button answered by id. ⌘W dismisses the ask for consistency with pick.
- **Keyboard contract**: exactly one button is highlighted at every moment and Return activates it.
  `default` names the initial highlight; without it the first button that is not `destructive` is
  highlighted, or the first button when it is the only one. Tab, Right, Down move forward; Shift-Tab,
  Left, Up move back; movement wraps. A hotkey activates its button directly. A `destructive` button is
  reachable by navigation and hotkey but may not be `default`; that is a validation error, never
  silently ignored. The active button is visibly distinct from the others in both styles.
- **Result shape** copies pick: `{"result":"answered","id":"yes","label":"Yes","index":0}`,
  `{"result":"escaped"}` or `{"result":"cancelled"}`; `index` is the caller's button order regardless
  of vertical layout.
  `ask.result` over the socket also reports `pending`; the blocking CLI prints only the terminal answer.
- **Tree** exposes `askPending` (the id) on the window node next to `pickPending`.
- **Naming**: `ask.open` / `ask.result` / `ask.cancel`; CLI `agtermctl ask`.

Rejected alternatives: `NSAlert` sheet (not theme-styled, ugly past three buttons); folding buttons into
`pick.open` (muddles a contract of 1..1000 searchable rows); session-scoped modality that leaves the other
pane usable (needs a pending indicator, hidden-focus rules, and move/close rules; can come later if a real
caller needs it); a rename of `PickController`/`PickRegistry` to a modal-neutral name (mechanical churn
across ten files for no behavior; the shared-slot predicate is named `modalPending` instead).

## Technical Details

### Protocol (`ControlProtocol.swift`)

- `Command`: `askOpen = "ask.open"`, `askResult = "ask.result"`, `askCancel = "ask.cancel"`.
- `ControlArgs` additions: `buttons: [ControlAskButton]?`, `defaultButton: String?`,
  `destructiveButton: String?`, `style: String?`, `align: String?`. Reused: `title` (notify's field), `message`
  (dialog body), `pane`, `paneID`, `window`, `follow`. `target` is the session for `ask.open` (optional)
  and the ask id for `ask.result`/`ask.cancel`. `ControlArgs` is synthesized `Codable` with no coding
  keys, so the additions are plain optional fields.
- `ControlResult.ask: ControlAskResult?`; `ask.open` answers `ControlResult(id:)` like pick, plus
  `result.pane` when a pane anchor was resolved: `--pane` changes where the dialog lands, and
  control-api.md requires a read-back for such a field, as `session.restore` does.
- `ControlAskButton { id, label, hotkey: String? }`, `ControlAskOutcome { pending, answered, escaped,
  cancelled }`, `ControlAskResult { result, id?, label?, index? }`, `ControlAskStyle { terminal, gui }`,
  `ControlAskAlignment { left, center, right }``
  in `ControlAsk.swift`.

### Validation (`ControlDispatcher+Ask.swift`, host-free)

- `ControlAskPlacement` carries parsed `pane` and unresolved `paneID` together in the host action.
- `title` required and non-blank; `title`, `message`, and every label free of control characters.
- 1...6 buttons (`ControlAskButton.maxButtons = 6`), unique ids, non-empty labels.
- `default` and `destructive` must each name an existing button; `default == destructive` is rejected
  with an explicit message.
- `style`, when present, is `terminal` or `gui`; anything else is `unknown style`.
- `hotkey` is one ASCII letter, stored lowercased, unique across buttons. Return, Tab, Esc, arrows,
  digits and punctuation are rejected so a hotkey can never collide with navigation or dismissal. A key
  event carrying Command, Control, or Option never activates a hotkey.
- `pane` parses through `parsePane` with `OverlayPane`; `pane` or `paneID` without a session target is
  rejected (`--pane requires a session`).
- `ask.result`/`ask.cancel` require a target id.
- Errors keep pick's phrasing: `ask.open requires a title`, `ask.open requires buttons`,
  `too many buttons (max 6)`, `ask button ids must be unique`, `unknown default button: X`, and so on.

### Model (`Ask.swift`, agtermCore)

- `PendingAsk { id, title, message?, buttons, defaultID?, destructiveID?, style, align, width?, anchor: AskAnchor? }`
  with `AskAnchor { sessionID: UUID, pane: OverlayPane?, paneIdentity: UUID? }`.
- `PickController` gains `pendingAsk: PendingAsk?`, `recentAskResults: [ResolvedAsk]`,
  `openAsk(_:) -> Bool`, `resolveAsk(_:)`, `cancelAsk()`, `askResult(for:)`, and the shared predicate
  `modalPending: Bool` (`pending != nil || pendingAsk != nil`). `open`/`openAsk` both refuse while
  `modalPending`. Each family retains its own history using pick's existing 8/32 caps, so ask traffic
  does not evict unread pick answers. The resolution sequence is shared with pick.
- `PickRegistry.unregister` cancels the pending ask and retains its results; `liveAsk(for:)` and
  `retainedAskResult(for:)` mirror the pick lookups.
- `AskNavigation` (host-free, in `Ask.swift`) holds the highlight state machine: `highlighted: Int?`
  seeded from `defaultID`, otherwise the first non-destructive button or first available button.
  `moveForward()` and `moveBackward()` wrap; `activate() -> Int?` is nil only for an empty list, `hotkey(_ letter:) -> Int?`. The app-side key
  catcher only maps key events onto these calls, so the whole keyboard contract is unit-tested in
  `agtermCore`.

### App host (`ControlServer+Ask.swift`)

- `openAsk`: with a session target, `resolver.resolveSession` finds the store and session, the window
  owning it is the modal owner, the session must be selected in that window (`session not visible`), and
  pane placement resolves through the HUD placement resolver moved to a shared file
  (`resolvePanePlacement(_:paneID:in:requireVisible:invalidPaneError:)`), capturing `paneIdentity`. Terminal zoom or an open
  dashboard in that window rejects an anchored open (`session not visible`). Without a target,
  `resolveOpenPlacementStore(window)` picks the window and the anchor is nil. `follow` raises the window.
- `askResult`/`cancelAsk` copy `pickResult`/`cancelPick` including window-mismatch and retained lookups.
- Tree: `askPending` is a top-level `ControlTree` field beside `pickPending` (`ControlProjection.swift`),
  populated through the same closure path: `AppStore.swift` tree builder (`pickPending:` parameter and
  call), the agterm-linux shim `ControlProtocolCompatibility.swift`, and the server closure in
  `ControlServer.swift`. Nil is omitted from JSON like `pickPending`.

### Modal gates

Every site that reads the pending pick switches to `modalPending`. The grep
`pick\.pending|PickRegistry\.shared|pickerActive|pickActive` over `agterm` and `agtermCore/Sources` finds
about 48 hits in 20 files, and the task is complete only when that grep shows no `pending != nil` read
left outside the pick host itself. Sites by kind:

- host-free: `PaletteCatalog.swift` `PaletteContext.pickerActive`, the input to `modalActive`, which
  `menu-actions.md` names as the single owner of menu enablement (rename to `modalPickerActive` or feed it
  from `modalPending`; `PaletteCatalogTests` covers it)
- menus and actions: `agtermApp+Menus.swift:68,330`, `AppActions.swift:48` (`uiActionsEnabled`),
  `AppActions+Focus.pickActive`, `agtermApp.swift:482,729,736`
- views: `GhosttySurfaceView.pickOwnsFocus`, `WindowContentView` frontmost/auto-follow handling and
  palette-close-on-open, `WindowContentView+Dashboard.swift:110`, `+Zoom.swift:177`,
  `+Titlebar.swift:192`, `+RecentSessions.swift` (six reads)
- control entry points refusing `pick pending` today: `ControlServer.swift:646` (dashboard),
  `ControlServer+AppCommands.swift:240` (quick terminal), `ControlServer+SurfaceIO.swift:404` (search),
  `ControlServer+SessionActions.swift:699,724` (zoom); their message comes from one
  `PickController.pendingModalError` (`pick pending` or `ask pending`) so the pick message and its tests
  stay unchanged

⌘W and Esc: `escapeAsk()` resolves `escaped`; termination and teardown call `cancelAsk()`.

### View (`agterm/Views/AskDialogView.swift`)

- Colors: `GhosttyApp.shared.terminalBackgroundColor` / `terminalForegroundColor` with the standard
  fallbacks; a one-cell border in the foreground at reduced opacity; font from
  `settingsModel.settings.fontFamily`/`fontSize` (the HUD's `cellSize` lookup).
- Layout: title (bold), message (wrapped), then buttons in one row when the widest layout fits the anchor
  frame minus padding, else one per row; caller order preserved either way. Width is clamped to the anchor.
  Content that exceeds the anchor height scrolls; keyboard navigation brings the selected button into view.
  A button is a filled block with a plain label; the highlighted one is drawn in inverse video (foreground and background
  swapped); the hotkey letter is underlined; the `destructive` button carries a leading `!` marker
  (`! Delete`) and bold weight, since the app has no access to the theme's ANSI red.
  A hotkey absent from its label appears as an underlined parenthesized hint.
- Input: `AskKeyCatcher` (`NSViewRepresentable`, modelled on `DashboardKeyCatcher`) owns first responder
  while mounted and maps Tab/Shift-Tab/arrows/Return/Esc/letters onto `AskNavigation` calls, dropping any
  event with Command, Control, or Option; mouse click on a button activates it; the scrim consumes clicks
  and does nothing.
- Placement: mounted beside `pickPaletteOverlay` at the top of `WindowContentView`'s stack (zIndex 20),
  not inside `windowOverlayLayer`, which is absent while zoomed. Geometry is live, not the HUD cache:
  `Session.hudPaneFrames` is observation-ignored, merges only non-nil frames, and keeps stale frames for
  hidden panes and deselected sessions, so it can neither drive resize nor prove visibility. Only the
  SELECTED session's detail (`isActive`) publishes an `AskAnchorPreferenceKey` with the session container
  bounds and each rendered pane's bounds, so the preference `reduce` never merges frames from the other
  deck sessions the `ForEach` keeps mounted at opacity zero; the ask host resolves the anchors in its own
  coordinate space (sidebar and titlebar offsets included). Session-wide uses the container bounds, `--pane` the named pane's bounds, no anchor
  the terminal area center below the titlebar and right of the sidebar. Validity is derived from state, not from the preference:
  `store.selectedSessionID == anchor.sessionID`, and for a pane anchor the captured pane IDENTITY is
  resolved to its CURRENT role first (`Session.askTargetPane`, the same identity-to-role lookup as
  `hudTargetPane`), then `session.rendersPane(role)`; a nil role or a false `rendersPane` cancels. Both
  geometry and validity use that resolved role, never the pane name given at open: when the primary
  shell exits, `closePrimaryPane` promotes the right survivor and its identity to `left`, so a
  right-anchored ask follows its pane into the left slot. Following one identity through a role change
  is geometry movement, allowed; only a different anchor would be relocation, which never happens.
- Accessibility ids: `ask-dialog`, `ask-title`, `ask-message`, `ask-button-<id>`.

### CLI (`agtermctlKit/AskCommands.swift`, `Ask` command)

```
agtermctl ask TITLE [--message TEXT] --button ID=LABEL [--button ...] [--hotkey ID=K ...]
             [--default ID] [--destructive ID] [--style terminal|gui]
             [--target SESSION] [--pane left|right] [--pane-id TOKEN] [--window W] [--follow] [--no-block]
agtermctl ask result ID
agtermctl ask cancel ID
```

- `--button ID=LABEL` splits on the first `=`; a missing `=` uses the token as both. `--hotkey ID=K`
  attaches a hotkey to a declared button.
- `--target` is `ask`'s own optional option, not `TargetOptions`, whose default of `active` would turn
  every no-target call into an anchored one and break terminal-area placement.
- `--pane-id` exposes the existing stable-token wire field, with the same target requirement as `--pane`.
- `Ask.self` is registered in `Agtermctl.configuration.subcommands` (`agtermctlKit/Commands.swift`).
- Default subcommand is open. Blocking poll, delays, abandon-on-transport-failure, and exit codes (0
  answered, 3 escaped, 2 cancelled, 1 failure) reuse the pick helpers, generalized to take the outcome kind.
- `--no-block` prints `{"id":...}`. The one-shot `ask result ID` prints whatever the socket reports,
  `pending` included, and exits 1 for pending like `pick result`.

### Events

No events: pick emits none either. Recorded here as the deliberate exemption from the
event-arguments rule.

      with `pendingModalError` supplying the message; finish with the grep from Technical Details showing
      no read left outside the pick host

- [x] `dismissPendingAsk(userInitiated:)` for ⌘W; `cancelAllPendingModals` for termination
- [x] auto-follow suppression and quick-terminal hide pair with the ask exactly as with the pick
- [x] tests: `PaletteCatalogTests` case for `modalActive` under a pending ask
- [x] build the app target and attempt `ControlPickUITests` once; UI verification skipped because the
      runner timed out enabling automation mode before any test methods ran. Core and hosted checks passed.

### Task 6: Dialog view, keyboard, and placement

**Files:**
- Create: `agterm/Views/AskDialogView.swift`
- Create: `agtermTests/AskDialogViewTests.swift` (native keyboard/scrolling and render attachments)
- Modify: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermCore/Session.swift` (`askTargetPane`),
  `agtermCore/Tests/agtermCoreTests/SessionTests.swift`
- Modify: `agterm/Views/WindowContentView.swift` (mount at zIndex 20 beside `pickPaletteOverlay`),
  `agterm/Views/WindowContentView+Detail.swift` (publish `AskAnchorPreferenceKey` from the selected
  session's container and rendered panes)

- [x] panel with theme colors, terminal font, title/message/buttons, horizontal-or-vertical layout
- [x] `AskKeyCatcher` maps key events onto `AskNavigation` (letters without modifiers, Esc, Return, Tab,
      arrows) and nothing else
- [x] mouse activation on buttons; scrim swallows clicks; destructive marker and inverse-video highlight
- [x] live anchor geometry from the preference in the host's coordinate space (session container, one
      pane, or whole-window center); the frame follows resize and sidebar changes
- [x] `Session.askTargetPane` resolves the captured identity to its current role; validity from state
      (selected session, resolved role, `rendersPane`); the host cancels the ask when it fails
- [x] test in `SessionTests`: a right-anchored identity resolves to `left` after `closePrimaryPane`
      promotes the survivor, and to nil once the pane is gone
- [x] accessibility identifiers
- [x] launch isolated Debug with a short explicit socket and fresh-shell state; socket checks passed for
      resize, hidden-pane cancellation, session collapse, deselection, and pane promotion. Stopped its
      exact PID with SIGTERM. Live keyboard/click/screen capture skipped: macOS denied the helper those
      permissions. Native-host keyboard/scrolling tests passed and test-generated renders were inspected.

### Task 7: CLI command

**Files:**
- Create: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermctlKit/AskCommands.swift` (`MiscCommands.swift` is 741 lines and
  the pick family alone is about 200; the package already splits per family)
- Modify: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermctlKit/MiscCommands.swift` (share the poll loop with pick)
- Modify: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermctlKit/Commands.swift` (register `Ask.self`)
- Modify: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermctlKit/SocketClient.swift` (exit code and format helpers)
- Create: `agtermCore/Tests/agtermctlKitTests/AskCommandsTests.swift` (the existing CommandsTests is at its line limit)
- Modify: `agtermCore/Tests/agtermctlKitTests/SocketClientTests.swift`

- [x] `Ask` command with `Open` (default), `Result`, `Cancel`; button and hotkey parsing; its own
      optional `--target`
- [x] register `Ask.self` in the root subcommand list
- [x] blocking poll and abandon reuse the pick loop, generalized over the outcome kind
- [x] tests through `Agtermctl.parseAsRoot`: every option, `ID=LABEL` split, default subcommand, no
      target means no `target` in the request, request shaping
- [x] tests: exit codes and result formatting
- [x] run `swift test --filter agtermctlKitTests` (463 tests passed, using the existing clean scratch path)

### Task 8: Hosted UI tests

**Files:**
- Create: `agtermUITests/ControlAskUITests.swift`
- Modify: `agtermUITests/ControlAPITestCase.swift` (ask helpers next to the pick helpers)

- [x] render, click a button, `askPending` in tree, result id/label/index, dialog dismissed
- [x] keyboard: no default leaves Return inert, Tab then Return answers the first button; hotkey answers
- [x] Esc with a cancel button answers it; Esc without returns `cancelled`
- [x] `ask.open` while a pick is pending is rejected, and the reverse
- [x] `dashboard`, `quick`, `session.search`, and zoom commands are refused while an ask is pending
- [x] `ask.cancel` on a dialog with a named cancel button returns `cancelled`, not the button; closing
      the window while pending returns `cancelled` and the result stays readable afterwards
- [x] `--pane right` on a split session draws within the right pane frame; a hidden session rejects open;
      selecting another session by control while anchored resolves `cancelled`; collapsing the split under
      a session-wide anchor keeps the dialog up
- [x] an unanchored ask opened while zoom is active renders above it; an anchored one is rejected
- [x] run only `ControlAskUITests`: 13 of 14 passed initially; corrected the render test to read macOS
      static text `value`, then that method passed on its targeted rerun. No other UI suite ran.

### Task 9: Documentation

**Files:**
- Modify: `.claude/rules/control-api.md`, `.claude/rules/menu-actions.md`, `site/commands.html`,
  `site/docs.html`, `plugins/agterm/skills/agterm/SKILL.md`, `reference.md`, `examples.md`;
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` does not list control widgets and `cookbook/` stays untouched

- [x] control-api.md: ask section (validation, shared slot, dismissal kinds, anchor rules, events
      exemption) beside pick
- [x] menu-actions.md modal cover list names the pending ask
- [x] commands.html: `ask` section with arguments and read-back; docs.html mention in the control widgets
      list
- [x] skill reference and examples: the command, one hook example (a yes/no before a destructive step)
- [x] no surface states a command count

### ➕ Task 10: Escaped result, filled buttons, and the gui style

Eugene's review of the built dialog changed the contract after Task 9 documented it. This task moves the
code to what the docs already say; the Solution Overview above is the authority.

**Files:**
- Modify: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermCore/ControlAsk.swift` (`escaped`, `ControlAskStyle`),
  `ControlProtocol.swift` (drop `cancelButton`, add `style` and `align`),
  `Ask.swift` (drop `cancelID`, add `style` and `align`),
  `Pick.swift` (`escapeAsk()`), `ControlDispatcher+Ask.swift` (drop the cancel role, validate `style`)
- Modify: `agtermCore/Sources/agtermctlKit/AskCommands.swift` (drop `--cancel`, add `--style`),
  `SocketClient.swift` (`escaped` exits 3)
- Modify: `agterm/AppActions+Focus.swift` (`dismissPendingAsk` becomes escape, no button lookup),
  `agterm/Views/AskDialogView.swift` (filled buttons, `gui` rendering), `agterm/Views/WindowContentView.swift`
  (Esc resolves `escaped`)
- Modify: every test that named the cancel role: `ControlProtocolTests`, `AskTests`,
  `ControlDispatcherAskTests`, `AskCommandsTests`, `SocketClientTests`, `ControlServerAskTests`,
  `AskDialogViewTests`, `ControlAskUITests`

- [x] `ControlAskOutcome.escaped`; `escapeAsk()` on the controller; Esc and ⌘W resolve it
- [x] remove `cancelButton`/`cancelID`/`--cancel` and the cancel-versus-destructive rule everywhere
- [x] `style` on the wire, validated host-free, carried on `PendingAsk`; CLI `--style`, default `terminal`
- [x] `align` on the wire (`ControlAskAlignment { left, center, right }`), validated host-free, carried
      on `PendingAsk`; CLI `--align`, default `right`; both styles and the vertical fallback honor it
- [x] docs: add `style` and `align` to control-api.md, commands.html, docs.html and the skill reference
      where Task 9 described `style`
- [x] unanchored placement centers over the terminal area: `askAnchorFrame` with no anchor starts at
      `terminalAreaInset`, not x 0, so the sidebar is excluded like the pick palette; UI test asserts
      the dialog's minX is at or right of the sidebar's maxX with the sidebar visible
- [x] long labels never clip: in the vertical fallback a button's label wraps within the panel width
      (the width clamp applies to the text, not only the panel), and the panel never exceeds the anchor;
      hosted render check with a label longer than the anchor is wide
- [x] terminal style: every button on a dim fill (foreground at low opacity), the active one solid
      foreground with background-colored text, filled block and hotkey underline kept
- [x] gui style: picker's `PalettePanelBackground`, corner radius and appearance handling, system font,
      headline title, secondary message, native push buttons in a trailing row, `.borderedProminent`
      highlight, red-tinted destructive; same `AskKeyCatcher` and `AskNavigation`
- [x] CLI exit 3 for `escaped`; `ask result` one-shot maps it the same way
- [x] update unit, hosted and UI tests to the new contract; Esc and ⌘W cases assert `escaped`
- [x] UI tests: `--default` then Return answers the default; Right arrow then Return answers the second
      button; a `--style gui` open renders `ask-dialog` with native buttons and answers by click
- [x] hosted render check of both styles in light and dark appearance
- [x] run `-only-testing:agtermUITests/ControlAskUITests` and the affected core suites
- [x] one button is always highlighted: `AskNavigation` seeds from `default`, else the first
      non-destructive button, else the first; `activate()` never returns nil for a non-empty list; the
      inert-Return unit and UI cases become "Return without default answers the first non-destructive
      button"; the terminal active style must read as active at a glance against the dim fills

### ➕ Task 11: Demo fixes

From Eugene's case-by-case review of the Debug build on 2026-09-05. Terminal style only; the gui
style passed as is.

**Files:**
- Modify: `agterm/Views/AskDialogView.swift`, `agtermTests/AskDialogViewTests.swift`
- Modify: `.claude/rules/control-api.md` and the skill reference only where they state the panel width

- [x] message text is drawn in a muted foreground (foreground at reduced opacity), the title stays full
- [x] the frame border is dimmer than today's 60 percent foreground; pick a value that reads as a
      quiet outline against both light and dark themes
- [x] the panel takes its content's natural width instead of filling the anchor, capped at 90 percent
      of the anchor width and the 72-cell maximum; a short question gets a short panel, a long one
      keeps a margin on both sides; the column fallback and wrapping still apply within the cap
- [x] hosted render checks: short question in a narrow pane, long label in a narrow pane, light and dark
- [x] targeted `AskDialogViewTests` and `-only-testing:agtermUITests/ControlAskUITests`
- [x] terminal buttons drop the `[ ` and ` ]` brackets; the filled block is the button. The destructive
      button keeps its `! ` prefix. Update `buttonLabel`, its tests, the Solution Overview rendering
      bullet, and every doc line that shows a bracketed button; re-run the targeted render and UI checks
- [x] gui uses the same width rule as terminal: the content's natural width, capped at 90 percent of the
      anchor and the same maximum, so a short question gets a compact gui panel too
- [x] `width` on the wire and `--width N` on the CLI, an integer percent of the anchor width from 10 to
      100, in both styles; when given it fixes the panel width instead of the auto rule (still never
      wider than the anchor); absent means auto; out of range is `width must be 10 to 100`.
      CLI non-integers use that message; malformed wire types use the ordinary decode error.
      Decoration like `style` and `align`: carried on `PendingAsk`, no read-back; validated host-free with
      dispatcher tests, CLI parsing tests, a hosted render at 50 percent in both styles, and docs beside
      `align` in control-api.md, commands.html, docs.html and the skill reference
- [x] equal-width buttons within one dialog: in the row layout every button takes the widest button's
      width; in the column layout every button takes the column's width; both styles; a wrapped long
      label still wraps within that shared width; hosted render with "OK" beside "Cancel everything"

### Task 12: Verify acceptance criteria
- [x] every decision in Solution Overview is implemented and has a test
- [x] `cd agtermCore && swift test`
- [x] `make test-app`
- [x] `make lint` with zero findings
- [x] Debug instance: manual pass of the keyboard contract and a theme switch while the dialog is up,
      in both styles. Socket theme-change/pending/cancel checks passed in both styles.
      Keyboard input and visual theme checks skipped: accessibility, screen-capture, and event-posting
      permissions are denied. Isolated PID 60256 stopped with SIGTERM.

### Task 13: [Final] Update documentation
- [x] CLAUDE.md if a new constraint surfaced during implementation (none; the ask contract lives in
      control-api.md and menu-actions.md)
- [x] move this plan to `docs/plans/completed/` (deferred to the merge: the exec run leaves the plan in place)

## Post-Completion

**Manual verification**:
- run the bundled skill's example hook against a Release build installed with `make deploy`
- confirm `agtermctl ask` from inside a session with no `--target` still draws at terminal-area center

Smells pre-check: skipped — non-Go project
