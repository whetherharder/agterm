## Application-hosted tests (`agtermTests/`)

These run inside the app, so a mistake can kill the host instead of failing an assertion.

- **Set `isReleasedWhenClosed = false` on every test-owned `NSWindow`.** The initializer defaults true;
  `close()` can over-release a window still held by `registeredWindows`/`WindowRegistry`, then crash at
  the main-queue autorelease-pool pop. xcodebuild reports `Restarting after unexpected exit, crash, or
  test timeout`, may restart and finish, and can fail only on CI or after unrelated tests alter reuse.
  `orderOut(nil)` is safe.
- For a dead host, inspect `xcrun xcresulttool get test-results tests --path <xcresult>`.
  `~/.local/state/ghostty/crash/*.ghosttycrash` is a sentry envelope: split its header and
  item-header/payload pairs, write the minidump attachment as `.dmp`, then run
  `lldb -b -o "bt all" -c <dmp>`. CI discards both sources, so temporarily upload the crash directory
  and `build/DerivedData/Logs/Test/*.xcresult` under `if: failure()`, then remove the step.
- **A menu fixture needs `NSMenuItem.usesUserKeyEquivalents = false` in `setUp`, restored in `tearDown`.**
  AppKit substitutes an App Shortcut from System Settings by menu-item title as soon as the item joins a
  menu, a detached one included, replacing the key equivalent and mask the test just set. Titles like
  "Paste and Match Style", "Zoom" and "Close" are real system commands, so a developer who rebound one
  fails on his machine alone while CI stays green. `defaults read -g NSUserKeyEquivalents` names the
  bindings. Suppress the substitution rather than renaming fixtures: `CloseSessionChordTests` needs the
  real "Close" to test chord ownership, and the substitution matches invented titles just as readily.
- Never stub `GhosttyApp`; its handler is the only crash record.
- `AGTERM_HOSTED_TESTS=1`, set by the `agtermTests` scheme, renders `Color.clear` and skips the scene task
  that assigns `appDelegate.library`; it stays nil. SwiftUI's `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` also makes
  `NSApp.delegate as? AppDelegate` nil, so obtain the delegate another way. The local placeholder window
  exists (`NSApp.windows.count == 1`, title "Agterm"), but another-process CI launch may hit FB11763863
  and create none.

## UI tests

- `agtermUITests/` launches the real app and drives UI behavior unavailable to host-free tests.
  Run with `xcodebuild test -project agterm.xcodeproj -scheme agterm -destination 'platform=macOS'`.
- Default UI-test launches bypass live-session wrapping through the existing UI-test sentinel. Only the
  focused zmx persistence test sets `AGTERM_UITEST_ENABLE_ZMX=1`; it must kill its exact test daemons in
  teardown so they cannot leak into later tests.
- Pass a temporary `AGTERM_STATE_DIR` in the launch environment; `agtermApp.restoredStore()` honors it.
  Verify the native `Open Directory...` panel manually.
- **Use `app.launchForUITest()`, never `app.launch()`.** FB11763863 on macOS 15+/Xcode 16+, including
  Xcode 26, can leave a
  process-launched SwiftUI `WindowGroup` with a Dock icon and AX elements but no `NSWindow`, task, or
  `onAppear`; activation/order-front APIs cannot create the missing window.
  `AppDelegate.bringUITestWindowsForward` responds by reopening
  `Bundle.main.bundleURL`. `launchForUITest()` sets `AGTERM_UITEST_FORCE_SIDEBAR_VISIBLE` in the
  environment, not arguments, launches, and activates. Keep Settings non-restorable because reopen
  retriggers restoration. Diagnose with timed `NSApp.windows.count` logging; persistent zero means
  "never created". See [[reference_swiftui-windowgroup-no-window-xcuitest]].
- Use retrying `settingsControl(tab:control:)`; reopen can leave a non-key Settings window that drops the
  first tab click.
- Add UI coverage for UI behavior. For Metal/transient state absent from AX, assert an observable side
  effect, such as `tty > <file>` identifying the focused pane.
- `AppearanceFlipUITests` uses XCUITest-only `debug.appearance light|dark`, which sets
  `NSApp.appearance` and posts `.agtermSystemAppearanceChanged`; production uses app-level KVO.
  Refuse the command outside XCUITest and exempt it from keep-in-sync. Set a starting side, assert the
  echoed response, and poll the bare form's last-applied side. To catch a zoom-clearing misroute, sample
  `fontSize` continuously: current libghostty `update_config` does not reset runtime zoom, so CELL_SIZE
  can repersist it about 0.4 seconds after a brief nil.
- For OSC titles, type literal `printf '\\033]2;TITLE\\007'; cat`; let the session shell expand escapes.
  `cat` prevents the next prompt from clearing the title. Raw ESC/BEL bytes can trigger line-editor
  keystrokes. Read display name from the `session-row` static text's value, and subtitle from
  `palette-subtitle`'s value. Assert cwd against `/Users/`, not the runner's different home.
  `tree --json` exposes raw `title`; see `SessionSubtitleUITests` and
  `ControlAPIUITests.testTreeExposesOscTitle`.
- `ReorderUITests.dragRow` must select the source and drain the run loop, drag between normalized
  coordinates, and use mouse-native
  `click(forDuration:thenDragTo:withVelocity:thenHoldForDuration:)`. Element-to-element targets the
  recycled cell text; touch `press(forDuration:thenDragTo:)` delivers AppKit dragging intermittently.
  Run one drag per fresh launch. For failures, log `validateDrop`/`acceptDrop`: no events means the
  gesture never started; wrong `dest` means delegate resolution. Query the last 90s of unified logs.
- **Never run XCUITests while the user is testing a handed-off build.** They activate apps and send real
  keyboard/mouse events even in the background. Run them before handoff or after the user finishes.
  Host-free tests are safe.
- Always run `cd agtermCore && swift test`, normally about 0.2 seconds. Ask before XCUITest.
  The tree is 44 classes and 429 methods, and a class costs about its own test bodies: 31 seconds for
  EditMenu's four, 7.5 minutes for ControlAPI's 82. Per-method preamble is about 0.1 seconds; if it
  returns to 18-25 seconds the scheme's `preferredScreenCaptureFormat` has regressed to
  `screenRecording`, whose per-method video startup made a full run take 2.5 hours.
  Target exact affected methods with one
  `-only-testing:agtermUITests/<Class>/<method>` each. A behavior-preserving extraction with unchanged AX
  identifiers needs `make build` and lint, not UI tests. Recommend a class/broader run only for changed
  cross-cutting behavior such as launch, signing/bundle, eager-deck, or scene/window wiring.
- After changing a test, run `build-for-testing`; app-only `xcodebuild build` leaves a stale XCUITest
  bundle for `test-without-building`. A stale assertion may appear as `Executed 0 tests` plus restart and
  a named failure. Read the xcresult failure message, or use `xcodebuild test`.
- Palette identifiers propagate to text children, so a subtitle row can have duplicate matches whose
  `firstMatch` title is not hittable. Click
  `allElementsBoundByIndex.first { $0.isHittable } ?? matches.firstMatch`, but keep lazy `firstMatch` for
  existence waits; eager resolution before the row exists breaks
  `testPickKeepsKeyboardAfterClosingBuiltInPalette`. Fast `Not hittable: StaticText` is this issue, not
  the slow occlusion timeout. See `ControlPickUITests.clickPaletteRow`.
- For `.segmented` Picker, click the labeled descendant. For a default/menu Picker, click the picker then
  `app.menuItems["X"]`. Update the interaction when changing style; see the Settings picker tests.
- XCUITest-synthesized clicks do not fire a SwiftUI `Button` inside `NSPopover`; a real click makes the
  popover key. Test open and contents, then verify selection manually and through host-free APIs. Put AX
  ids on rows, not a parent that would override descendant ids. Retry opening only while no row is
  visible, since the popover can dismiss before the first snapshot. See the recent/attention tests and
  [[menu-actions]].
- `Failed to synthesize event: Timed out while synthesizing event` or `Unable to find hit point` after
  about 90 seconds, with no assertion, indicates window occlusion such as HazeOver. The observed keyboard
  failure occurred about 64 seconds after synthesis began and the same test passed in about 13 seconds
  without HazeOver. Quit overlays and
  clear covered/minimized/other-Space windows before debugging the test. FB11763863 instead has no
  window/AX tree.
- `XCUIApplication.terminate()` does not call `applicationWillTerminate`. Use ⌘Q plus
  `wait(for: .notRunning, timeout:)` for restore-command or quit-flush tests; XCUITest auto-skips the
  quit-confirm modal. `MultiWindowUITests` survives hard termination only because structural saves
  already persist the open set. Use a temp file, not unreliable `NSLog`, to instrument the callback.
- Dismiss Settings by the close button of `app.windows.containing(.any, identifier: <a control on the
  tab>)`. ⌘W also closes it and leaves the deck alone (issue #401, pinned by
  `SettingsUITests.testCommandWClosesTheSettingsWindowNotTheSession`), but only while Settings is KEY —
  the reopen path above can leave it open and non-key, where ⌘W reaches the terminal window behind it
  and takes a session with it.
- `ghostty_surface_foreground_pid` is `tcgetpgrp`, so it returns the foreground process GROUP id. Under a
  job-control shell that leader IS the program; a `--command` pane has no such shell and its leader is
  unreadable setuid-root `login`, which is why the tree read descends to the leader's children and the
  restore capture does not (see [[control-api]]). Restore skips only a known idle
  shell with no payload arguments except flags; shell scripts and `sh -c` payloads are captured. Use
  blocking `tee <file>` as the e2e marker and prove relaunch by delete/recreate.
  `RestoreCommandUITests.testRestoreReRunsShellScriptWrapper` uses `sh -c 'tee ...; true'` so `sh` remains
  foreground. Do not execute a script from the runner's sandboxed temp dir; the app can write there but
  cannot exec it.
- The runner's sandbox grants `network.client` only, so an `NWListener` in the test fails `bind` with
  EPERM. A test needing an HTTP server has the app run it in a background session
  (`session.new` with `/usr/bin/python3 -m http.server PORT --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory DIR`) and polls
  it from the runner as a client; see `ControlHtmlOverlayUITests`.
