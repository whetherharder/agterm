## Menu bar and actions

- `@MainActor AppActions` shares nontrivial behavior among titlebar/footer, menu, palette, and control:
  placement, directory picking, split/focus, and font. Trivial toggles may call their owner directly.
- **`PaletteCommand.isEnabled(in:)` is the single owner of menu enablement.** Every menu item backed by a
  palette row spells its `.disabled(…)` as that predicate, the palette row renders inert on it, and a
  `keymap.conf` alternative dispatches through it in `AppActions.perform(_:in:)` (see [[keymap]]), so the
  three cannot drift. It layers `isVisible(in:)`, then the modal cover, then the presence terms
  (no active session, no current workspace). Add a term to `PaletteContext` and the predicate; never to one
  item's `.disabled(…)`. An action's own `AppActions` method keeps its guard as well — belt and braces, not
  the contract.
- Window modal covers include terminal zoom, the dashboard, picks, and GUI asks. Terminal asks use
  session/pane input ownership; see [[control-api]] for priority and lifecycle.
  Close Session, both reloads, the three font sizes and Toggle Terminal Zoom carry no modal term
  (⌘W is how a cover is dismissed); Dashboard carries every cover but its own grid, its item being that
  grid's escape hatch. Items with no palette row (window management, the three palette launchers) keep the
  bare `context.modalActive`.
- `isVisible(in:)` stays WIDER than `isEnabled(in:)`: the palette lists Rename Session with no session and
  renders it disabled, and `runItem` neither runs nor dismisses it. Do not narrow `isVisible` to match the
  menu — that deletes rows users search for.
- **`PaletteItem.isEnabled` is a closure over live state, never a flag captured when the list was built.**
  `filtered` refreshes only on appear, query and mode, so a snapshot goes stale under an open palette: a
  session exits, a pending close expires, control mutates the tree. The row asks it during body evaluation
  and `runIfEnabled()` asks it again at the keystroke, returning whether it ran — which is the only thing
  that dismisses the palette, so an inert row cannot close it on a keystroke that did nothing.
- `toggleQuickTerminal` gates on all `uiActionsEnabled`, including terminal zoom and dashboard.
  Control drives `QuickTerminalController.shared` directly, there being one panel per app. The titlebar
  button is replaced by dashboard chrome, which hides an open quick terminal before showing the grid.
- Every new action must satisfy the control contract in [[control-api]]: protocol, dispatch, CLI, and
  protocol/end-to-end tests. Do not restate per-action audits here.

## Dock menu

- `applicationDockMenu` exposes New Session, New Window, Quick Terminal, Dashboard, captured-window MRU
  sessions, and attention ordering.
- New Window alone is app-scoped (Discussion #313): capture nothing, call
  `newWindow(ignoringModals: true)`, enable only when `actions != nil`, and explicitly unhide/activate.
  Do not mark it always enabled before the action hub is wired. Require `openWindow` before persisting an
  open entry. Menu and palette New Window retain modal gating.
- Other items capture store and window ID at build time. Recheck per-window modal/controller state, raise
  that window, synchronously publish it frontmost, then dispatch. A stale closed/modal item is inert;
  dashboard built open may close it, but one built closed becomes inert if it opens before invocation.
- `NSMenuItem.target` is weak and AppKit sends nil sender. Retain closure targets until the next rebuild,
  invalidate old targets first, and capture session IDs rather than `Session` or surfaces.
- Selection uses the pre-reset indicator returned by store selection and reveals pane tags only for
  blocked/completed. Active and idle use ordinary focus.
- `navigableRecentSessions`, excluding current and capped by `SessionSwitcher.maxCandidates`, supplies
  visible-scope MRU entries. Hosted coverage uses `make test-app`, isolated state/socket variables, and
  `AGTERM_HOSTED_TESTS=1`; never add that sentinel to the UI-test scheme. Dock actions compose existing
  control capabilities.

## Menu organization and shortcuts

- View contains display state: font/theme, sidebar and workspace expansion, flagged/focus controls,
  split/scratch/find/quick terminal, and fullscreen. Navigate contains palettes, session/attention
  stepping, pane focus, and Dashboard. File UI tests against the menu that owns the item.
- Workspace focus controls are mode-agnostic because membership applies when tree mode returns.
  Expand/Collapse Workspaces and Collapse/Expand Workspace need workspace ROWS
  (`PaletteContext.sidebarShowsWorkspaceRows`): the ordinary tree or the flagged tree, not the flat flagged list.
  Previous/Next Workspace keep the narrower `sidebarShowsWorkspaceTree`, since `navigateWorkspace` steps the
  focus projection and would land on a workspace the flagged tree has no row for.
  An init call that omits `sidebarShowsWorkspaceRows` takes `sidebarShowsWorkspaceTree`, which is what keeps
  the `agterm-linux` fork's fold commands visible.
- Dashboard uses Command-Shift-G, `BuiltinAction.dashboard`, and `toggleDashboard`; it toggles an MRU,
  auto-sized grid unless terminal zoom is active. Share `dashboardMembers` with control.
- The View menu carries no fullscreen item of agterm's own, and `toggle_fullscreen` rides the key monitor
  rather than a menu shortcut; see [[windows]]. It remains rebindable and control-drivable.
- Font shortcuts call libghostty binding actions on the key window's first-responder surface, falling back
  to the active session, unless an HTML page owns the keys, which zooms the pages instead ([[control-api]]).
  Persistence still flows from cell-size callbacks.
- `shortcutGlyph` delegates to host-free `Keymap.glyphHint`. Use it for palette hints and the ten built-in
  toolbar/sidebar tooltips so rebinds update both. This visual text is keep-in-sync exempt.

## Search

- `BuiltinAction.toggleSearch` defaults to Command-F and drives the focused surface's `start_search`.
  View > Find and the palette read its configured equivalent.
- `START_SEARCH` toggles: if this session's bar is visible, send `end_search`; otherwise open, seed the
  returned needle, and focus. `END_SEARCH` clears all four ephemeral fields and refocuses the terminal.
  TOTAL/SELECTED convert negative `ssize_t` to nil. Copy callback strings before the main-actor hop.
- Wire all four callbacks through `wireSearchCallbacks` for main, split, and scratch. Surface methods are
  thin binding-action wrappers; `AppActions` owns GUI needle/navigation/end behavior. The same session
  state and `searchDisplayText` back `session.search`.
- Scratch is searchable; quick terminal and full overlay are not. `searchTarget` checks a covering scratch
  FIRST, then returns nil when the focused pane sits under its own pane overlay, then falls back to the
  focused surface. That order is load-bearing: the scratch covers a pane overlay too and is searchable.
  Keep the pane-overlay rung in `searchTarget` alone; `coverHidesActiveSession` covers only the
  session-wide blockers, and duplicating the rung there blocks Command-F on the scratch above it.
  Floating overlay leaves pane search available.
- On scratch exit, clear search only when `searchSurface === scratchSurface`; pane-owned search survives.
  Split/primary teardown follows the same ownership rule.

## Split panes

- `isSplit` means both panes are shown, `hasSplit` means the second shell exists, `splitAxis` chooses
  left/right or top/bottom, and `splitFocused` chooses focus. Split title/cwd feed focus-aware display name
  and focused cwd based on `splitFocused`, even hidden.
  `effectiveCwd` remains primary and seeds new terminals; a custom command's `AGT_SESSION_PWD` resolves
  through `cwd(for:)`. `activeSurface` follows focus.
- Creating a split focuses right. Hiding retains both shells and shows the focused pane maximized;
  reshown splits preserve focus. `closePrimaryPane` promotes right into primary with cwd/title/foreground
  command; `closeSplitPane` keeps primary when both exist and otherwise closes the session.
  `focusAfterReparent` restores focus after the surviving view changes host.
- Pane focus actions, menu/palette, and `session.focus` gate on `hasSplit`, not `isSplit`, so they also swap
  the maximized hidden pane. Ctrl-1/Ctrl-2 use an app-wide event monitor and always consume these reserved
  keys, even when no split exists.
- Swap Panes is a role-and-view exchange, exposed through View, the action palette, and `session.swap` with
  no default shortcut. It gates on `hasSplit`, including a hidden split, and stays available under terminal
  zoom and the dashboard. Focus follows the terminal; axis and ratio stay with the layout.
- The store exchange keeps each terminal's pane-owned state together: surface role, cwd/title, live and
  pending foreground command, restore pin and pending restore command, creation command and wait policy,
  pane overlay model/surface/exit code, and status ownership. Host identity must resolve from the current
  surface occupant before any public swap entry point is added.
- Persist each pane cwd and the 0...1 primary-pane `splitRatio`. `SplitRatioAccessor` is an unconditional
  background representable on primary, introspects `NSSplitView`, retries until its axis extent exists, observes
  `didResizeSubviews` but writes only during a drag, and debounces save by about 0.4 seconds. Regular saves and quit flush also persist it.
- Double-clicking the divider restores `splitRatioDefault` through the same `applyRatio` path as
  `session.resize`, persisting immediately rather than through the drag debounce. AppKit offers no hook:
  `NSSplitView`'s own double-click collapses a pane through the delegate SwiftUI owns. One shared
  `SplitProbeView` monitor, installed with the first split and removed once the last probe leaves its window
  (a probe freed without that callback leaves it installed, passing every event through an empty weak
  claimant table), sees the second click
  after the first one's drag-tracking loop ends, so dragging is unaffected; consume that press and its
  release so neither starts a drag nor reports a phantom button-up. The target is `dividerOwns`, the band
  already used for the resize cursor, so the gesture claims no pixel that could have selected a word.
  `clickCount == 2` also matches a re-grab after a nudge-drag, so require the divider not to have moved
  since the previous press.
- `SplitRatioAccessor` masks only the compact-titlebar divider overrun. At 30pt compact height, SwiftUI
  padding lies inside the safe-area band and AppKit expands `NSSplitView` full height; normal 48px mode is
  already bounded. Compute the live overrun and apply a CALayer mask, removing it at zero.
  Do not use SwiftUI mask/clipping because it reflows and loses the terminal's top row; do not use an
  opaque cover because it breaks translucency. Key each `HSplitView`/`VSplitView` identity by session and
  keep the terminal surface identities stable when changing axis.
- Sidebar icon follows `hasSplit` and `splitAxis`. The titlebar has seven accessibility states: `none`,
  `both`, `left`, and `right` for the left/right symbols, plus `both-horizontal`, `top`, and `bottom` for
  the top/bottom symbols. A shown split fills both halves; a hidden split fills the visible primary or
  split half on its current axis.

## Close and reselection

- Command-W dismisses a window pick or GUI ask, or the terminal ask that owns input. Ask dismissal
  returns `escaped`, as with Esc; input ownership is defined in [[control-api]].
  Then come the quick terminal (un-zoom, then hide), terminal zoom,
  dashboard, session overlay, scratch, and the focused pane's overlay (`focusedOverlayPane`; a sibling's
  overlay does not intercept). Only then close the active session, or the window when no session remains.
  Keep cover checks before the active-session lookup; a sessionless window can still show a modal.
- The panel's two rungs read `holdsKey`, not `isVisible`. A PINNED panel (a control `quick show`) stays on
  screen without owning the keyboard, and Command-W in a terminal window must then close that session
  rather than reach past it to the panel.
- The menu item diverts to a plain `performClose` when the key window is not an agterm terminal window —
  Settings, the About panel, an open/save panel — because `applyCloseSessionChord` takes ⌘W off the stock
  File ▸ Close item and nothing else would close them (issue #401). `WindowRegistry.contains` is the
  predicate, as in `CustomCommandRunner`, EXCEPT for `QuickTerminalPanel`: it is unregistered too but it is
  a cover, not an auxiliary window, and being borderless it has no close button, so `performClose` would
  only beep and the ladder's own panel rungs would never run. A `nil` key window still runs the deck sequence: with every
  window minimized the equivalent still dispatches, and `performClose` on nothing would make ⌘W silently
  no-op. The divert is gated on `close_session` still holding ⌘W, the same condition
  `applyCloseSessionChord` splits on: rebound off it, the stock item takes the chord back and the
  auxiliary window closes itself, so the new chord keeps its labelled meaning.
- All active-session close paths use host-free `closeReselectionTarget` (Discussion #147). Prefer the most
  recent survivor in three widening scopes: same workspace intersected with `navigableSessions`, all
  navigable sessions, then the whole tree. Build scopes from the post-removal tree; soft close retains
  recency until grace finalization for undo.
- This preserves the current workspace when possible, remains inside flagged/focused views while they
  contain survivors, and lets `disableFocusIfSelectionOutsideSet` reveal a whole-tree fallback while
  preserving membership.
- If MRU is empty, narrowed modes use `nearestInScopeTarget` over flattened sidebar order; unfiltered tree
  uses the sole `reselectionTarget` caller. Do not choose the first flagged row because it destroys locality.
  Closing the last flagged session widens to the whole tree rather than leaving no terminal.
- Workspace removal uses `workspaceRemovalTarget`: most recent visible, then first visible, then positional.
  Preserve `softCloseSessions.removedBeforeActive` for fallback index adjustment. The named
  close/reopen/filter tests in `AppStoreCloseReselectionTests` pin these scopes.
- Delete Workspace centralizes confirmation in `AppActions.deleteWorkspace(_:in:)`, then removes surfaces,
  recency, and reselection. Row menus pass their own store because right-clicking a background window does
  not raise it. Menu/palette target active workspace and enforce `uiActionsEnabled`. Keep at least one workspace.

## Navigation

- Previous/Next Session default to Option-Command-Up/Down; First/Last have no hotkey. Avoid bare
  Command-arrows because menu equivalents shadow caret navigation in rename, palette, and settings fields.
  Option-Command-Left/Right remains pane focus.
- `navigateSession` uses `navigableSessions`, wraps previous/next, selects ends for first/last, chooses
  first on nil/invalid selection, and no-ops when empty. Menu, palette, and `session.go` share it.
- Previous/Next Workspace are the level above: `navigateWorkspace` steps `currentWorkspaceID` through
  `visibleWorkspaces` and lands on the target's FIRST session, so the keybind, the palette row and
  `workspace.go` mean one thing. Keyless, tree mode only, and it reveals a landed pane off the step's
  captured indicator exactly as plain session nav does. **Collapse is not a navigation filter** —
  `navigableSessions` and `navigateWorkspace` both ignore `isExpanded`, and adding a term to either would
  silently rewrite where every existing keystroke, `session.go` call and Ctrl-Tab candidate lands.
- Previous/Next Window are the level above THAT, and the only navigation pair keyed on the library rather
  than a store: `WindowLibrary.navigateWindow` steps the open windows in library order, wrapping, and raises
  the target. Keyless, and live in either sidebar mode — a window has no sidebar row for flagged mode to
  hide. `PaletteContext.canStepWindows` is the enablement term, so one open window disables rather than
  no-ops. Menu, palette and `window.go` share the one step. The raise and the frontmost publication follow
  [[windows]]: `WindowRegistry.raise` directly, never the `openWindow` hub, and `takeFrontmost` explicitly,
  because the key monitor fires this from the quick terminal with agterm inactive.
- When selection moves, GUI callers reveal a captured blocked/completed pane; unchanged plain navigation
  only refocuses, preventing a one-item wrap from resetting split focus. Modal focus guards still apply.
- Attention navigation defaults to Control-Option-Up/Down, includes blocked/completed only, wraps, and
  excludes current. If it finds no other target, GUI callers may use the current live indicator solely to
  reveal its tagged pane. Control changes selection only.
- `revealActiveBlockedPane` focuses right only when the split surface exists, explicitly chooses primary
  for left/nil, and shows/focuses scratch. Promotion retags right to left. Idle/active never change pane or
  dismiss scratch. Navigation, palettes, sidebar, Dock menu, titlebar attention, and auto-follow share it.
- Sidebar selection expansion/scroll makes the target visible. Spatial navigation is distinct from MRU
  Ctrl-Tab and fuzzy Ctrl-P.

## Palettes, rename, and switcher

- `PaletteController`/`CommandPalette` consume `paletteActions`, `paletteSessions`, and host-free
  `fuzzyScore`/`paletteSearchKeys`. Store the visible results in state on query/mode changes so rendering
  and Enter target cannot diverge; sort by score then title. Built-in palettes match label plus subtitle;
  caller-supplied pickers match the label only, so subtitle consequence text cannot filter a safe row out
  and leave a destructive one preselected. Ctrl-P opens sessions; Ctrl-Shift-P opens actions.
- An empty query skips ranking in two cases: attention mode and a caller-supplied picker. Both keep their
  source order, because every row scores 0 and the tie-break would re-sort A→Z and replace the row Return
  runs. Every other palette lists everything A→Z.
- Attention mode lists every open window's non-idle sessions (`WindowLibrary.attentionAcrossWindows`),
  ordered blocked, active, completed and then newest `statusChangedAt`, with nil last, as one combined
  sort. Palette items carry status plus per-call color/shape, resolved by the same helpers as sidebar
  glyphs, a subtitle naming the window once more than one is open, and `isEnabled` asking the OWNING
  window's modal gate. A pick defers `AppActions.selectAttention` past the palette's close, which raises
  another window before selecting. Typed queries use fuzzy score.
- Open attention through `show_attention` (Ctrl-Shift-I), Navigate > Go to Attention, or Show Attention
  in the action palette. The titlebar bell opens a popover, not this palette. Palette opening is
  keep-in-sync exempt.
- Keep the next-runloop `fieldFocused = true` retry: button-opened palettes otherwise lose first responder,
  even though no current titlebar button uses this path.
- Rename actions post begin-edit notifications; the Coordinator edits the selected row asynchronously after
  palette dismissal. `renamePending` suppresses terminal focus restoration for about 0.6 seconds.
- Ctrl-Tab snapshots `sessionRecency` and cycles without reordering until commit. Limit candidates to 10
  while retaining 100 history entries. Persist optional recency, drop stale IDs, and float restored
  selection on load (#110). Host-free tests cover the cap because XCUITest releases Control.
- Use app-wide key-down and flags-changed monitors for Ctrl-Tab, reverse, Esc, and release-to-commit.
  The overlay has no focusable control, so terminal first responder remains.

## Titlebar popovers

- Keep clock and bell popovers in `WindowContentView+RecentSessions` so `WindowContentView.swift` remains
  below 1000 lines. They use
  `SessionPopoverRow`: optional status glyph, hover selection color, full-row hit target, terminal
  background, and chrome text.
- Clock lists up to `maxCandidates` recent visible sessions excluding active and enables only with at
  least two sessions. Selection records activity, selects, and focuses.
- Bell lists all non-idle sessions across open windows, current included. Selection uses the same
  pane-aware reveal as the palette; see [[notifications]] for the cross-window raise.
- Popover opens are keep-in-sync exempt. Synthesized XCUITest clicks inside `NSPopover` do not fire the
  SwiftUI button, though real clicks do; tests verify open/list contents, while selection is manual plus
  host-free API coverage.
