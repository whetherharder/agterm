## Keymap

- `<configDir>/keymap.conf` (default `~/.config/agterm`) rebinds built-in menu shortcuts and defines
  custom shell commands, which appear in the action palette as `custom`. One parsed `Keymap` drives the
  menu, custom-command monitor, and palette; host-free logic lives in `agtermCore`.
- `global-hotkey <chord>` is the third verb: ONE chord, modifier or function key required,
  no `|` alternatives and no leader sequence (`RegisterEventHotKey` expresses neither).
  Last line wins. It is registered with the OS
  by `GlobalHotkey`, never with `KeybindMatcher`, so it is deliberately OUTSIDE the conflict model below —
  it may share a chord with a menu item — but the OS hotkey WINS and CONSUMES the key, agterm frontmost
  included, so the menu binding then never fires. Say that rather than "whichever app is in front decides",
  which is the precise inversion. Ship NO default: registering takes the chord from every other application
  on the machine, a cost nobody who never summons the panel from outside agterm should pay. Binding it to
  `quick_terminal`'s own ``ctrl+` `` is the supported way to get one chord everywhere, and both user-facing
  surfaces (`site/docs.html`, the `ConfigPaths` keymap starter) must say so.
  `parseGlobalHotkeyLine` diagnoses a base key no physical position produces,
  since the verb has no read-back anywhere and a silent drop at registration would be the user's only signal.
  `keyCode(forChordKey:)` resolves it
  by physical position, inverting `namedKey`/`latinKey` rather than adding a third table, so it survives a
  layout switch. It summons the quick terminal; see [[windows]] for the panel.
- `parseKeymap` never throws. `map <chord> <action>` takes one whitespace-delimited chord token.
  `command "<name>" [chord] [error options] <shell...>` treats the token after the quoted name as a shortcut only when
  `parseKeybinds` accepts it with a modifier or a bare function key;
  other bare keys are diagnosed and stay palette-only.
  Parse `--error-hud`, `--error-position POS`, and `--error-pane left|right` as a contiguous prefix
  after that optional chord, in any order. Position uses `HudPosition.parse`, aliases included.
  The first ordinary shell token or `--` ends option parsing; preserve the remaining substring and
  never seek another chord. Missing/invalid values, duplicate flags, unknown leading `--error-*`,
  or placement without `--error-hud` diagnose and skip the command. Defaults: false, center, no pane.
  `CustomCommand` Codable and `ControlKeymapCommand` read-back carry all three fields.
  Empty shell text is invalid. Both verbs split on spaces/tabs. Blank lines and comments are skipped;
  inline `#` starts a comment only after whitespace and outside double quotes. Each bad line yields
  `KeymapDiagnostic{line,message}` without stopping later lines. `{AGT_X}` text remains verbatim.
- `|` is the top separator tier: it splits a chord token into alternatives, `>` splits a sequence into
  chords, `+` splits a chord into modifiers and a base key. Both verbs take it, inside the single token
  with no spaces around it — `parseCommandLine` hands everything after that token to the shell.
  The first menu-bindable single-chord alternative of a `map` line becomes the key equivalent; every other
  alternative, from either verb, is dispatched by the `CustomCommandRunner` monitor via `builtinSequences`.
  A `map` line offering no menu-bindable alternative records the action in `builtinUnbound`, because
  ABSENCE from `builtinOverrides` already means "keep the shipped default". A line that bound NOTHING is
  different again: whether its alternatives fell to a rule at parse time or to the cross-section passes
  afterwards, the action goes back to its shipped default, since the file never asked to move it.
  `unboundAfterRestoringStrandedDefaults` owns the second half and skips an action whose default something
  else took meanwhile — being unbound is what freed it.
- Per-alternative grammar follows the dispatch path, not the verb. The menu-bound alternative keeps `map`'s
  own rules (bare non-arrow legal, reserved chords and modifier-less arrows rejected); every monitor-bound
  alternative requires a modifier or a function key on its first chord,
  since an ordinary bare first key would be swallowed everywhere in the terminal.
- A malformed alternative kills the whole line deliberately — `parseKeybinds` returns nil, so a typo cannot
  hide behind a line that half worked. On a `command` line that token would otherwise be swallowed as shell
  text with no diagnostic, so `hasMalformedAlternative` tells a typo from a real pipeline: a `|` token where
  at least one half parses is a binding, `ls|grep foo` is not.
- A rule violation or a conflict drops that alternative alone and leaves its siblings firing, on either
  verb. Do not turn either into the other.
- Diagnostics quote the raw substring and never re-render it: `displayString` canonicalizes spelling and
  would change `|`-free files' diagnostics. `DropScope` owns the suffix that keeps single-alternative
  wording byte-identical (`map skipped`/`keybind dropped`/`treating the line as palette-only` with one
  alternative, `alternative skipped`/`alternative dropped` with more), pinned by
  `KeymapTests.pipeFreeKeymapParsesExactlyAsItDidBeforeAlternatives`.
- Pure types live in `Keybind.swift`, `KeybindMatcher`, `CustomCommand`/`CommandContext`,
  `BuiltinAction` (48 cases, pinned by `BuiltinActionTests`), `Keymap`, and `ConfigPaths`.
  `CommandContext` owns the shared expansion/environment token table.
- Built-ins use AppKit menu key equivalents from `keymap.equivalent(for:)`; apply only non-nil
  `KeyboardShortcut`s. SwiftUI rebuilds menu shortcuts on the next activation, not immediately after
  `keymap reload`, and resolves stock collisions by unbinding agterm's item.
- `AppDelegate.applyCloseSessionChord` clears stock File > Close ⌘W while `close_session` owns it and
  restores it otherwise. Run at launch, `.agtermKeymapChanged`, asynchronously after `didBecomeActive`,
  and during menu tracking because every rebuild can reapply the collision. ⌘W is the only built-in with
  a stock competitor.
- Diagnose live shortcut state with `agtermctl keymap list`, whose `actions` and `menu` expose parsed and
  dispatched chords through host-free `namedKey(forKeyEquivalent:)`; the actions column's contract is owned
  by [[control-api]], and only its first field can appear under `menu`. `overridden` compares the resolved
  menu chord against the shipped default, so an action left with alternatives only reports `overridden` with
  no `chord` when it ships a default, and stays unmarked when it is keyless. Test the reload path, not
  only a seeded file: see `CloseSessionChordTests`,
  `CustomCommandRunnerTests.testKeymapReloadRebindsTheBuiltinAlternatives`, and
  `KeymapUITests.testCloseSessionReclaimsCommandWAfterReload`.
- `CustomCommandRunner` uses an app-wide local `.keyDown`/`.keyUp` monitor.
  Its `KeybindMatcher` supports simple chords and leaders such as `ctrl+a>g`,
  times leaders out after 1.5 seconds, and consumes repeats/releases for presses it consumed.
  `NSMenu.willSendActionNotification` also records current F-key presses dispatched by AppKit menus,
  so their repeats/releases stay consumed without predicting from a stale keymap or intercepting the
  first press. Mouse and programmatic menu actions without a current F-key down record nothing.
  Track held keycodes independently: a leader tail can arrive before its prefix is released.
  `.fired` launches detached `/bin/sh -c` with cwd, selection, and `$AGT_*`; stdin and stdout go to
  `/dev/null`. Only `errorHud` commands capture stderr to a temp file (`StderrFile`, `CommandFailure`),
  reading its last 16 KiB before removing it. A pipe would break background descendants after agterm exits;
  the file avoids that, but its write size is unbounded until every writer exits.
  A spawn error or non-zero exit always calls `notifyCommandFailure`, which obeys the notification
  setting. Only `errorHud` adds a panel through injected `FailureHud`, with the name, reason and any
  usable stderr line. `errorPosition` defaults to `HudPosition.defaultPosition`; `errorPane` defaults nil.
  Resolve an explicit left/right role at failure time. Placement rejection falls back to session-wide
  at the configured position and logs it; other errors do not retry, and program overlays keep their slot.
  HUD auto-hide owns the ten-second lifetime (`failureHudSeconds`); [[control-api]] owns that contract.
  Exit 0 reports nothing whatever it printed. `.firedBuiltin` routes through `AppActions.perform(_:in:)`, a reverse lookup over
  `PaletteCommand.allCases` on `builtinAction`, falling
  back to `paletteLessHandler(for:)` — the sole listing of the actions holding no palette row, partitioned
  against `PaletteCommand` by `AppActionsPaletteTests`. Rebuild the matcher from commands AND
  `builtinSequences` on `.agtermKeymapChanged`.
- **An alternative does what its line's MENU chord does, no more and no less.** So `perform(_:in:)` runs the
  palette row's body behind `PaletteCommand.isEnabled(in:)`, the single predicate the menu item spells as
  its `.disabled(…)`; [[menu-actions]] owns it, so never restate a menu term here or in `perform`.
  `close_session` is the one row whose menu BODY differs from
  its palette row: the menu falls back to closing the key window when there was no cover and no session, so
  `perform` takes `closeActiveSessionOrWindow(_:)` with the window the chord fired in, not the palette's
  ungated `closeActiveSession()`. The `paletteLessHandler` half has no palette row to carry the predicate,
  so each of its entry
  points holds the gate itself — the three palette launchers on the full `uiActionsEnabled`, not zoom and
  picker alone, since their menu items are disabled over the dashboard. The key is
  consumed either way: the gate lives inside each action, so the runner cannot see the outcome, and passing
  a leader's last chord through after swallowing its prefix would type a stray character into the terminal.
- Fire with a focused `GhosttySurfaceView`, or in an agterm terminal window whose focus is not an `NSText`
  field editor, including a zero-session window. Pass through text fields and auxiliary windows;
  `WindowRegistry.contains(keyWindow)` gates no-surface dispatch.
- Palette `run(_:)` no-ops without an active session. A no-surface chord uses the active session when
  available; otherwise `spawnSessionless` supplies empty session fields plus frontmost window/socket so
  launchers still work. If `referencesSessionScopedContext` finds any session/workspace/selection token
  in `{...}` or `$...` form, no-op with notice; empty `{AGT_SESSION_PWD}` can turn `rm -rf .../*` into a
  root glob. Commands using only `AGT_SOCKET`/`AGT_WINDOW`/`AGT_PANE` may run sessionless.
- `{AGT_SESSION_HOST}`/`$AGT_SESSION_HOST` is the SSH destination of a `zmx attach` session, empty
  otherwise; an `ssh` typed into a local session leaves it empty while `AGT_SESSION_PWD` still follows
  any cwd reports that shell emits. `AGT_SESSION_PWD` stays the pane's reported path, remote or not; the
  command's execution directory comes separately from `Session.localWorkingDirectory`, which returns
  that path for a local session and, for a remote one, only when it exists here as a directory, else
  HOME. Scratch, overlay default, quick terminal, a local split (the first on an unsplit remote session
  or one after the attach-time split closes), Duplicate Session and a new session under the
  current-directory setting seed through the same helper.
- `{AGT_PANE}`/`$AGT_PANE` is `left`, `right`, or `scratch`, derived from the firing surface for keybinds
  and `splitFocused` for palette runs. The scratch and both overlay kinds are the sessionless surfaces with
  a pane, resolved together in `sessionlessPane`; the quick terminal is nobody's pane and takes the plain
  active-session path. An overlay reads its OWN selection into `$AGT_SELECTION` but names the pane
  UNDERNEATH it (#434), so a note taken in one still pastes back through `session type --pane` — which is
  why `CommandContext.Pane` deliberately cannot spell an overlay; its buffer is `session overlay copy`/
  `text`, owned by [[control-api]]. A single pane is always `left`. Primary exit promotes the
  split into the main slot, clears `isSplitPane`, and makes it addressable only as `left`.
- `{AGT_PANE_ID}`/`$AGT_PANE_ID` is the stable token of the surface in that slot, `Session.paneToken(for:)`,
  read from the slot rather than the firing surface because an overlay's own view carries no token (#602).
  It is the same value `--pane-id` consumers resolve, so an overlay chord carries the token of the pane
  it names, and a scratch chord the scratch's own. Empty in the sessionless context, and deliberately
  not session-scoped so a launcher naming it still fires there.
- `resolveBuiltinOverrides` is order-independent: fold last-wins candidates, resolve all final chords,
  then drop every overridden owner of each collision together. A drop reverts to the shipped default, so
  repeat to a fixpoint; distinct shipped defaults and strict candidate removal guarantee termination.
  Diagnostics name a conflicting owner and sort by line. Moving `toggle_split` off `cmd+d` lets
  `new_session` take it in either line order, and an action in `builtinUnbound` resolves to no chord at
  all, so it stops occupying its shipped default here too.
- Final cross-section `validateBindings` runs after parsing all lines, over every monitor-bound
  alternative of both verbs, in two passes. `dropShadowedAlternatives` drops the alternative whose first
  chord hits a final built-in menu chord or that holds a reserved chord; it reads one alternative against
  the menu chord set, nothing else. `dropConflictingAlternatives` then settles what `keybindConflicts`
  reports. A custom command whose every alternative went ends up palette-only with `shortcut == ""`.
- **The whole conflict rule, and the only one:** compute the relation ONCE over what pass 1 left, then in a
  single pass drop BOTH sides of a cross-target duplicate-or-prefix pair and the LONGER side of a same-target
  prefix pair, which is dead anyway because `KeybindMatcher` fires the shorter. Nothing is recomputed, no
  drop cascades, and no target ranking or ordering tie-break enters it, so neither `|` order nor line order
  can decide an outcome. **Accepted cost:** an alternative whose only conflict was with one that also
  dropped still dies. That is the price of determinism — never add a recovery pass, a fixpoint or a
  re-derivation to reclaim it. Pinned by
  `KeymapTests.aBindConflictingWithTwoOthersDropsBothOfThemInEitherLineOrder`,
  `anAlternativeChargedForAConflictWithADroppedOneGoesInEitherAlternativeOrder`,
  `lineOrderDoesNotDecideWhichBindingsSurvive` and
  `alternativeOrderInsideOneBindingDoesNotDecideAnotherBindingsFate`. Only the offender a diagnostic quotes
  follows file order, where a bind conflicts with several.
  `isReservedMonitorChord` covers control+tab with any extra modifiers and control+1/2 with Control alone,
  anywhere in a leader, and also rejects built-in maps. This keeps menu and monitor registrations
  disjoint without relying on dispatch order. Standard menu items such as ⌘Q/⌘C/⌘, remain AppKit's
  responsibility.
- `BuiltinAction.defaultChord` is the sole built-in default. Every menu item resolves
  override-or-default, including the six arrow actions. Two keyed actions are delivered by a monitor
  rather than a menu equivalent: `undo_close` through `UndoCloseShortcut`, so native text undo still
  works, and `toggle_fullscreen` through `CustomCommandRunner`, because agterm ships no full screen menu
  item for it to ride — see [[windows]]. Both are absent from `keymap list`'s `menu` by design.
- Write shifted symbols as `shift+<base>`: `shift+/` for `?`, `shift+=` for `+`, `shift+5` for `%`, and
  `shift+.` for `>`. `CustomCommandRunner` uses `characters(byApplyingModifiers: [])` to recover that
  base; keep `KeymapUITests.testCustomCommandShiftedSymbolFires`.
- Named keys are `left/right/up/down/tab/space/return/delete` and `f1` through `f20`.
  `parseMapLine` rejects modifier-less arrows because an always-on menu equivalent would swallow
  navigation in terminals, palettes,
  dashboard, and text fields. Bare non-arrow built-in maps remain legal, and a bare arrow can be a
  leader tail such as `ctrl+a>left`.
  Bare function keys may start commands, map alternatives/leaders, and global hotkeys.
  `global-hotkey f5` takes F5 machine-wide, including from local map/command bindings.
- Host-free `namedKey(forKeyCode:)` is shared by `CustomCommandRunner` and `UndoCloseShortcut`.
  `KeybindTests` pins its range exactly to `bindableNamedKeys`; keep
  `KeymapUITests.testCustomCommandArrowChordFires` because a private-use AppKit glyph can otherwise
  create an unspellable runtime chord.
- **Resolve chords per layout, not per produced key** (issue #306).
  `KeyboardLayout.isASCIICapable` reads
  `kTISPropertyInputSourceIsASCIICapable` on every keypress (about 0.22 microseconds, no cache/observer).
  `chordKey` uses the produced character for ASCII-capable layouts and ANSI
  `latinKey(forKeyCode:)` position for non-ASCII layouts. Do not use a per-key ASCII fallback: Greek Q
  emits `;`, Hebrew Q emits `/`, and Hebrew can collapse two physical positions to `,`, causing false
  firing plus consumed input.
- Drop ISO section key code 10 on non-ASCII layouts because Ukrainian-PC `\` and Hebrew-PC `;` collide
  with table codes 42/41. Keypad/number-row aliases are deliberate because keypad output is
  layout-independent. Keep `latinKey` disjoint from named-key codes and pin every entry individually;
  real ANSI constants are non-monotonic at 4/5, 22/23, and 25/26/28/29. Non-ASCII layouts can bind only
  Latin positions, not their produced Cyrillic glyphs.
- Do not merge this policy with `InterruptKeystroke`, which classifies one produced letter.
  The live non-Latin monitor branch cannot be unit-tested because tests cannot change the input source.
  `characters(byApplyingModifiers: [])` re-translates synthesized runner events through the live layout;
  `UndoCloseShortcut` uses verbatim `charactersIgnoringModifiers`. Hosted tests pin wiring and named-key
  precedence; host-free tests take `layoutIsASCIICapable`.
- Do not switch the runner to `charactersIgnoringModifiers`: it breaks shifted-symbol normalization and
  still cannot test the non-Latin branch. The accessor means `undo_close` cannot match shifted
  punctuation/digits on ASCII layouts (`shift+/` parses `/`, but runtime reports `?`); shifted letters
  work, and non-ASCII physical lookup works. Hosted tests skip when the machine layout is non-ASCII.
  After monitor changes, manually verify a letter, `cmd+r>t`, `ctrl+a>d`, and ⌘Z on isolated
  Russian-Phonetic and U.S. instances. Russian-Phonetic does not cover Greek/Hebrew punctuation, which
  host-free measured-data tests cover.
- `ghostty.conf` has a separate upstream grammar: bare `g` is Unicode and `key_g` physical; Unicode
  triggers cannot fire on non-Latin layouts. agterm matches Ghostty.app and cannot fix this app-side.
  Use `key_`, as `ghostty-defaults.conf` does for `super+key_c/key_v/key_a` (issue #30).
  The `ghostty` section of `site/docs.html` documents the distinction.
- A built-in reaches a leader only as an alternative, never as its menu equivalent: an `NSMenuItem` holds
  exactly one key-equivalent character. Literal `+`/`>` are separators and not
  bare tokens, but bind as `shift+=`/`shift+.`. `increase_font_size`'s stored `Chord(key:"+")` cannot
  round-trip and prints `(not expressible)` in the starter file. Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-1/2 are reserved,
  monitor-driven, and not rebindable. Palette custom hints use raw kitty syntax, not macOS glyphs.
- `shortcutGlyph(for:)` over `glyphHint(for:)` is the single resolver behind built-in palette hints and
  the toolbar/sidebar tooltips. It space-joins the menu chord's glyphs and each alternative's, a sequence's
  own chords joined by `>` so a run cannot read as one chord (`⌘T ⌃␣>S`),
  returns the alternatives alone for an unbound action, and nil when there is neither.
- The starter file's `map` and `command` examples are literal chords that rot when a new built-in claims
  one, as `dashboard` previously did to the shipped `cmd+shift+d` (issue #405). Keep
  `ConfigPathsTests.starterKeymapExamplesApplyWhenUncommented`, which uncomments every example, requires
  it to parse clean, and counts the chords that survive.
  Both verbs rot: `validateBindings` clears a custom shortcut a built-in has claimed just as
  `resolveBuiltinOverrides` drops the colliding `map`.
- New shipped defaults must not break a valid existing keymap. `parseKeymap` vacates the new horizontal
  split default when an old file explicitly uses `cmd+shift+d`, and vacates Dashboard's new default when
  an old file explicitly uses `cmd+shift+g`. An explicit map for the new action opts into its new chord.
- **`{AGT_X}` interpolation is intentionally raw and unquoted.** Selection, OSC title, OSC 7 pwd, and the
  session/workspace/window names and `--cwd` a caller supplies over control or the GUI can all inject
  visible shell metacharacters. `TerminalText.sanitized` strips control characters, not `;`,
  `$()`, or backticks. Prefer quoted exported `"$AGT_X"` variables for untrusted text. Do not add quoting
  to `CommandContext.expand`.
- File > Reload Keymap, the palette entry, and `keymap.reload` all call
  `AppActions.reloadKeymap()` > `SettingsModel.reloadKeymap()`, which reparses and posts
  `.agtermKeymapChanged`. Apply the Control API four-point audit.
- Edit Keymap is GUI-only. `AppActions.editKeymap()` opens a 95% floating overlay with
  `ConfigPaths.editorCommand(forPath:)`:
  `${SHELL:-/bin/zsh} -ilc 'exec /bin/sh -c '\''${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-vi}} "$1"'\'' agterm-config-edit '<path>''`.
  The interactive login shell loads exported editor variables; inner POSIX `sh` handles
  `${VAR:-default}` for fish and receives the single-quoted path as `$1`. Supported shells must accept
  `-ilc` and preserve single quotes (sh/bash/zsh/fish, not csh/tcsh); non-exported editor variables fall
  back to vi. Running POSIX expansion directly under fish exits 127. `ConfigPathsTests` cover zsh,
  optional fish, VISUAL precedence, rc sourcing, and quoting.
  Overlay close reloads only the recorded edit session. No control command is needed because scripts can
  compose `session overlay open "$EDITOR <path>" --size-percent 95`.
- `hooks.conf` shares `ConfigPaths`, `KeymapDiagnostic` and the Edit/Reload UX, not the parser:
  `parseHooksConf` keeps the shell remainder verbatim with no inline-comment stripping. Its contract is
  in [[control-api]].
