        # Three verbs:
        #
        #   map <chord> <action>
        #       Rebind a built-in action. Chords use kitty syntax: mods joined by `+`, e.g.
        #       `cmd+shift+l`, `ctrl+\\``. Mods: ctrl, cmd, opt, shift. A Shift-typed symbol is
        #       shift+<base key> (shift+/ for ?, shift+= for +, shift+5 for %). Several
        #       alternatives may be joined by `|` with no spaces around it; the first single-chord
        #       alternative becomes the menu shortcut and the rest fire through a key monitor, so
        #       their first chord needs a modifier or a function key (f1 through f20). A line offering
        #       no single chord leaves the action with no menu shortcut at all. Examples:
        #
        #           map cmd+shift+l     toggle_split
        #           map cmd+t|ctrl+a>t  toggle_scratch
        #
        #   command "<name>" [chord] <shell...>
        #       Define a custom command, shown in the action palette marked `custom`. The quoted
        #       name may contain spaces. An optional chord (single chord OR a leader like `ctrl+a>g`,
        #       or several of either joined by `|`) binds it to a key; every alternative must start with
        #       a modifier or a function key (f1 through f20). Others are dropped, and a line left with
        #       none becomes palette-only. Omit the chord for a palette-only command. The rest of the
        #       line is run via `/bin/sh -c`, detached with no terminal — so it suits fire-and-forget
        #       launches (GUI apps, scripts), NOT a bare interactive or full-screen TUI program, which
        #       has no TTY and exits at once. Launch a TUI over a session through an overlay terminal,
        #       as the Lazygit example does. The line resolves binaries against the app's GUI `PATH`:
        #       the launchd default plus the bundled agtermctl, /usr/local/bin and /opt/homebrew/bin.
        #       A bare agtermctl or Homebrew binary works; anything else your shell profile adds does
        #       not, so give it an absolute path or wrap the line in `zsh -lc '...'` — `zsh -ilc '...'`
        #       when that PATH comes from ~/.zshrc, which -lc does not read. The program an overlay or
        #       scratch terminal runs gets the app's own unwidened PATH and always needs one of those.
        #       Examples:
        #
        #           command "Open in Zed"  cmd+shift+e  open -a Zed "$AGT_SESSION_PWD"
        #           command "Lazygit"      ctrl+a>g     agtermctl session overlay open 'zsh -lc lazygit' --target "$AGT_SESSION_ID" --socket "$AGT_SOCKET"
        #           command "Deploy"                    ./deploy.sh
        #
        #   global-hotkey <chord>
        #       Bind ONE system-wide chord that summons the quick terminal while any application is
        #       frontmost — the only binding here that fires when agterm does not have the keyboard.
        #       Exactly one chord: no `|` alternatives, no leader sequence. A modifier is required
        #       except for function keys (f1 through f20). A second global-hotkey line replaces the
        #       first. macOS registers it by physical key position, so it works on a non-Latin layout.
        #       The system owns it, so it takes no part in the collision rules above. Note the
        #       precedence: the system hotkey WINS, agterm frontmost included, so a chord shared with a
        #       menu action fires this and the menu binding never sees it. There is no default because
        #       registering a chord takes it from every other application on your Mac, which is not a
        #       cost to impose on someone who never summons the panel from outside agterm. Spending it
        #       on the chord the in-app binding already uses is allowed, and is how to get ONE shortcut
        #       that works everywhere — at the price of that chord no longer reaching anything else.
        #       Examples:
        #
        #           global-hotkey ctrl+opt+space
        #           global-hotkey f5  # takes F5 machine-wide, including from local map/command bindings
        #           global-hotkey ctrl+`            # same chord as the in-app quick_terminal binding
        #
        # Built-in actions (raw name → shipped default chord):
        #
        \(actionLines)
        #
        # Custom-command tokens (expanded in the shell line and exported as $AGT_X env vars):
        #
        \(tokenLines)
        #
        # NOTE: a {AGT_X} token is substituted RAW into the /bin/sh line — convenient, but unsafe for
        # content you don't control. {AGT_SELECTION} is the obvious case, but a remote host can also set
        # the session title (OSC) and the working directory (OSC 7), so {AGT_SESSION_NAME} and
        # {AGT_SESSION_PWD} are equally unsafe raw. For any such content prefer the matching $AGT_X
        # environment variable, QUOTED, e.g. "$AGT_SELECTION".
        #
        # Uncomment and edit a line below to start.
